      "As a 3-month pregnant woman, it's crucial to focus on a nutritious diet to support both your health and your baby's development. During pregnancy, your energy needs increase by an average of 300 kcal/day [WHO Section: Maternal nutrition interventions across the life course]. A nutritious diet can help improve gestational weight gain, reduce maternal anemia, increase birth weight, and lower the risk of preterm birth, gestational diabetes, and excessive gestational weight gain [WHO Section: Women’s nutrition during pregnancy].\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a detailed nutritious diet plan focusing on various food groups and essential nutrients:\n",
      "\n",
      "**General Principles:**\n",
      "*   **Increased Calorie Intake:** Aim for an additional 300 calories per day. This can be achieved through healthy snacks or slightly larger portions.\n",
      "*   **Balanced Diet:** Focus on consuming a variety of foods from all major food groups to ensure adequate intake of energy, protein, vitamins, and minerals [WHO Section: Women’s nutrition during pregnancy].\n",
      "*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Food Groups and Recommended Servings (Adjusted for Pregnancy):**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Grains (Whole Grains Preferred):**\n",
      "    *   **Servings:** Aim for 6-8 servings per day.\n",
      "    *   **Examples:** Whole-wheat bread, brown rice, oats, whole-grain pasta, fortified cereals.\n",
      "    *   **Why it's important:** Provides energy, fiber, and B vitamins. The context emphasizes choosing whole-grain cereals and grains [WHO Section: Five food groups].\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Vegetables:**\n",
      "    *   **Servings:** Aim for 5 or more servings per day, with a good variety.\n",
      "    *   **Examples:** Deep green leafy vegetables (spinach, kale, broccoli), carrots, tomatoes, bell peppers, cooked legumes (beans, lentils) [WHO Section: Other nutritional considerations, Five food groups].\n",
      "    *   **Why it's important:** Rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Deep green leafy vegetables are a good source of iron.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Fruits:**\n",
      "    *   **Servings:** Aim for 2-3 servings per day, with a good variety.\n",
      "    *   **Examples:** Apples, bananas, oranges, berries, mangoes.\n",
      "    *   **Why it's important:** Provides vitamins (especially Vitamin C), minerals, and natural sugars for energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Protein:**\n",
      "    *   **Servings:** Aim for 3-4 servings per day.\n",
      "    *   **Examples:** Red meat (lean cuts), poultry, fish (sardines), eggs, cooked legumes (beans, lentils), soy products (tofu, tempeh), nuts, seeds [WHO Section: Other nutritional considerations, Five food groups].\n",
      "    *   **Why it's important:** Essential for the baby's growth and development, and for maintaining your muscle mass. Red meat, legumes, sardines, and soy products are good sources of iron [WHO Section: Other nutritional considerations].\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Dairy:**\n",
      "    *   **Servings:** Aim for 3-4 servings per day.\n",
      "    *   **Examples:** Milk, yogurt, cheese.\n",
      "    *   **Why it's important:** Excellent source of calcium, which is essential to protect your bone density during pregnancy and for the baby's bone development [WHO Section: Other nutritional considerations].\n",

      "**Special Nutritional Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Iron:** Your need for iron increases significantly during pregnancy because your blood supply doubles, and it's needed for the baby's developing blood supply.\n",
      "    *   **Sources:** Red meat, deep green leafy vegetables, cooked legumes, sardines, and soy products [WHO Section: Other nutritional considerations].\n",
      "    *   **Supplementation:** Most prenatal supplements contain iron, but you might need an additional iron supplement. Discuss this with your doctor [WHO Section: Other nutritional considerations].\n",
      "*   **Calcium:** Crucial for your bone density and your baby's skeletal development.\n",
      "    *   **Sources:** Dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese), fortified plant milks, green leafy vegetables.\n",
      "*   **Fortified Foods:** Look for foods like salt, wheat flour, rice, and cooking oils that are fortified with essential micronutrients [WHO Section: including fortification of salt, wheat flour, rice, and cooking oils].\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dietary Practices:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Meal Frequency:** Instead of 3 large meals, consider 5-6 smaller meals throughout the day to manage nausea and maintain energy levels.\n",
      "*   **Snacks:** Choose healthy snacks like fruits, nuts, yogurt, or whole-grain crackers.\n",
      "*   **Moderation:** Eat sweets and junk food in moderation, if at all [WHO Section: Five food groups].\n",
      "*   **Food Safety:** Ensure all food is properly cooked and stored to avoid foodborne illnesses. Avoid raw or undercooked meats, fish, and eggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Actionable Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Consult Your Doctor:** Discuss your diet plan with your doctor or a nutritionist. They can provide personalized advice, monitor your weight gain, and recommend appropriate micronutrient supplementation (like iron and folic acid) and deworming prophylaxis if needed [WHO Section: Women’s nutrition during pregnancy, Other nutritional considerations].\n",
      "2.  **Focus on Variety:** Make an effort to include a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in your daily diet to ensure you get a broad spectrum of nutrients [WHO Section: Five food groups].\n"
