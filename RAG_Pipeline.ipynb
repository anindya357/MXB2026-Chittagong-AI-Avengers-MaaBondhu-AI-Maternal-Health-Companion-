Such big success has been achieved for the current \\ngovernment's firm commitment to ensure public health and development. I strongly believe that this \\nprogress of Bangladesh will continue and we will be able to achieve the sustainable development \\ntargets (SDGs) health indicators. From the time of Bangabandhu, the health sector has received special \\nimportance from the government. Constitution, all five-year plans of the country, political patronage, \\nbudget allocation, public relations, innovative initiatives to provide health care and the support & \\nguidance of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made health sector a huge success. In spite of all these \\nsuccesses, in order to reach the developed country as a healthy nation, we still have to pass a long way, \\nto increase the quality of service, to ensure universal health protection, to prevent every mother and \\nchild mortality. We still have a lot to do to improve the quality of healthcare, especially the mother, \\nnewborn and child health care service still not reached the desired level. Although there is good scope \\nfor receiving care of mother and child healthcare, there is a shortage in health centers in terms of \\nservice quality. Among other factors, the main obstacles in the field of mother and newborn services \\nare the lack of skilled workforce and poor management and the lack of an updated national strategy. \\nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare has formulated National Maternal Health Strategy 2019-30, \\nwith all the necessary components for the development of mother health and with specific guidance \\nin direction. This strategy will play a vital role in the improvement of maternal health, maternal illness \\nand death and, above all, the improvement of maternal and child health. We believe that, follow \\nthese strategies, formulate a national action plan,  formulate and implement the committee at the \\nlevel of the ministry and the directorate, formulate necessary funding, assistance and proven method, \\nemploying manpower and developing their skills will play an important role in the development of \\nchild and mother health. In the end, I would like to thank all of those who have contributed in making \\nthis strategy, and I hope that our collective efforts will continue to bring about a sustainable change \\nin mother and child health in Bangladesh.\\n Zahid Maleque, MP\\n Hon’ble Minister\\n Ministry of Health and Family Welfare\\n Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh\"),\n",

The maternal mortality ratio has been reduced from 322 to 194 per 100,000 \\nlive births from 2001 to 2010. The infant and under-five mortality rates have fallen sharply – from 66 \\nin 2000 to 38 in 2011 and from 94 to 46 respectively over the same period. I think these achievements \\nare results of continuous efforts of the government, especially of the present government, that has \\nput maternal, newborn and child health at the top of its development agenda. \\nHowever, there is no scope for being complacent. Because, there are areas where progress has been \\nrather slow. For instance, neonatal mortality is 28 per 1,000 live births and contributes 61% of the \\ntotal under-five deaths.\\nNewborn deaths are often the result of improper care during pregnancy, delivery and postnatal periods. \\nA combination of several factors such as absence of skilled birth attandants during delivery, harmful \\ntraditional practices, poor access to emergency care for complications and reluctance of the expectant \\nmothers to seek care from health facilities for delivery. We need to employ a comprehensive and \\nstandardized maternal health care regime to address these issues and improve the situation. The \\nMaternal Health Strategy provides clear strategic directions for reaching all women with the life-saving \\nservices. The Maternal Health Strategy for maternal health are basically a timely answer to that need. \\nI congratulate the people who worked relentlessly for developing the much-needed guideline.  \\nThe SOPs for Maternal Health services will serve as a guideline for managers and workers providing \\nmaternal, newborn and reproductive health services in a structured way. This is of vital importance \\nbecause service providers at different levels of the health system have different levels of skill and \\nexpertise, so a single source of procedural guidelines, when followed diligently, will help standardize \\nthe maternal and child healthcare.  \\nFinally, I thank the development partners who have all along been part of this endeavor.

The corresponding \\nratios in the BDHS 2004 and the BDHS 2011 among births in the three years before the survey were 1 \\nto 13 and 1 to 6, respectively.

For example MMR in Khulna division is 64, while it is 7 times as much as (425 per 100,000 \\nlive births) in Sylhet. \\nWomen living anywhere other than slums are most likely to receive at least four ANC compared to \\nwomen living in slums (58% versus 29%).

There is no systematic assessment of quality \\nof maternal care in Bangladesh such as long waiting times, lack of cleanliness, short consultation \\ntime with providers, disrespectful care, irregular availability of drugs, unexpected costs of service \\nwere reported by a study\\n14. Recent data from Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response \\n(MPDSR) showed that, 65% of neonatal deaths occur within the first six hours of birth, which points \\nparticularly to poor care at delivery. Market forces push towards increased, and often inappropriate, \\nuse of diagnostic and treatment procedures (e.g. cesarean sections) in private facilities where quality \\nof care is yet to be addressed by the government. \\nEfforts to ensure quality of care in MNH services are still sporadic. Maternal and Newborn health \\ncare standards have been adopted from the global WHO MNH Standards, following the WHO Quality \\nof Care framework and RMNCAH Quality of Care framework has also been developed.

Policies which have been consistently adopted over the last decades to \\npromote women’s education, employment, and status have played a major role. Factors that have \\nimproved health coverage and outcomes include: i) implementation of community based approaches \\nthrough investments in community health workers; ii) partnership agreements with NGOs to reach \\nthe most deprived populations; and iii) adoption of innovative technologies and interventions\\n17,18.  The \\ninfrastructure for comprehensive delivery care, including district hospitals (DH), upgraded mother and \\nchild welfare centers (MCWC) and upgraded upazila health complexes (UHC) has been created. GoB has \\nstarted educating professional midwives, in two tracks, three years direct entry diploma course and \\npost basic upgrades for existing nurse, midwives. In addition, CSBAs are being trained in safe delivery \\nskills to provide greater coverage of community services and adequately skilled staff to an increased \\nnumber of BEmOC and CEmOC facilities. Approaches to support demand through vouchers have been \\npiloted in several areas of the countries. The NGO sector, one of the largest and the most dynamic in \\nthe developing world, has played a critical role in poverty reduction and in innovating approaches and \\nin supplementing the efforts of the public sector. \\nHowever, as shown by data reported in the previous section, despite the progress in maternal health \\nand a significant reduction in inequity, access to and effective utilization of essential reproductive \\nmaternal and neonatal services are still far from sufficient, and a significant proportion of women \\nremains excluded from access to quality reproductive and maternal care.  Issues to be addressed are \\nboth on the supply and on the demand side, and require action within and beyond the health sector. \\nOn the supply side, the challenge is making the existing facilities adequately equipped, including \\nenergy, water supply and hygiene requirements and availability of skilled human resources. Initiatives \\nhave been undertaken to make selected upgraded UH&FWCs functional for conduction of 24/7 \\nnormal deliveries through a program to train FWVs in basic midwifery skills and ensure residency \\nin the same facility. Although there has been considerable recruitment during the HPNSDP 2011-16 \\nwith vacancy rates declining to around 15% in 2014 (20% in 2011), the human resource/population \\nratio is still disproportionate. There has been a considerable push on training of Community Skilled \\nBirth Attendants (CSBAs) and over 8,900 FWAs and Female HAs have been trained in public and \\nprivate training institutions. Vacancies, poor retention at posts, absenteeism, inadequacy in required \\nskills, and insufficient number of dedicated midwifes for normal delivery are the main challenges. \\nCEmONC services are often non-functional in most of the designated UHCs due to unavailability of \\nan obstetrician and anesthesiologist pair.

Government trained \\nCSBA could perform better if given proper supervision and health system support, building on the \\nexperience of NGO-run CSBAs projects. \\nOn the demand side, most births still take place at home, because many women have low decision-\\nmaking authority about where to deliver their babies, leaving these critical decisions to husbands, \\nmother in laws or other family members. Informed decisions on service utilization from reproductive \\nservices to antenatal, delivery and postnatal care are prevented by the low status of the woman \\nwithin the family, low awareness and poor recognition of health risks, lack of information on available \\nservices and providers in the area. Direct and indirect costs of care are still too high for many women.  \\nAlthough several demand side issues depend on social, economic and cultural factors, health services \\ncan contribute to improve reproductive health literacy and generate demand for services by adequate \\ncommunication strategies and materials, including the use of ICT, outreach activities, improved \\ncommunication skills of health providers at all levels. Mechanisms, such as vouchers, community based \\ninsurance and subsidized care can overcome financial barriers and prevent catastrophic expenditure.\\nEnsuring adequate financial resources is a key issue to be addressed to achieve equitable and effective \\ncoverage for essential MNH interventions. Currently, Bangladesh spends 3.4% of GDP on health, which \\nin per capita terms is US$ 16.2 (US$ 46 PPP) according to National Health Accounts 1997-2007. The \\nmain source of finance for total health expenditure is out-of-pocket spending by households (64%) \\nfollowed by government spending (26%), and external resources (8%). Public/Government health \\nspending is less than one percent of the GDP. Only 5.6% of the total government budget was spent on \\nhealth in financial year 2011-12 and the budget allocation request for health stands at 4.87% in 2012-13 \\n(MOF 2012). As acknowledged by the HNPSDP MTR 2014, the current level of government spending is \\nnot sufficient to ensure universal access to quality maternal health services.\\nBesides financial and human resource constraints, other factors causing bottlenecks in the supply of \\nand demand for maternal health services include: i) lack of a coherent system to support equitable \\naccess to services among poor people; ii) insufficient managerial capacity, particularly at local level; iii) \\ndivide between family planning and health services which impedes functional integration and better \\nuse of existing resources; iv) lack of clearly defined and functioning referral system; and v) lack of \\nregulatory and quality control systems and mechanisms.\\n1.3.2 Need for a whole-of-government, multi-sector approach \\nAn increasing amount of evidence shows factors that have impacts on reducing maternal and child \\nmortality include improving women’s education, status and role in society, fertility control, poverty \\nreduction, improved nutrition, improved living environments, as well as cross cutting dimensions \\nsuch as good governance and innovation\\n6. In Bangladesh, progress in many social determinants has \\ncontributed to the results achieved so far in reducing maternal and child mortality, but persistent \\ngaps represent obstacles to further progress. Poverty still has a very important impact on access to \\nservices and maternal outcomes. One out of three women are undernourished, and consequently, at \\nrisk of adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Illiteracy is still prevalent in over 40% of women with \\nimpact health related behaviors and utilization of health services. Adverse environmental conditions \\nin some areas contribute to rapid urbanization and growing slum population.

The magnitude of the \\nchallenges of scaling up and financing health services to establish universal coverage should not be \\nunderestimated, nor the burden put on families by health care costs.

This strategy, in accordance with recommendations of the HPNSDP MTR, \\nstrongly urges to review current public and private health expenditure, with a view to increasing per \\ncapita expenditure so that a greater proportion of the population including the vulnerable section has \\naccess to the essential MNH and EmONC package of health services.

Proper steps should be taken to ensure \\ncomplete financial coverage for all essential maternal health services under these schemes. The \\nHCFS also recommended scaling up demand side financing schemes like maternal health voucher \\nscheme, introduction of performance-based-payments and need-based resource allocation.

An essential requisite is to develop and adopt \\na HR strategy and corresponding plan, and an integrated human resource information system, as \\nrecommended by the HPNSDP MTR.  An HR strategy and plan for MNH should encompass all the \\nhealth workforce issues including financing, recruitment, deployment, transfer, promotion, career \\nplanning, monitoring and capacity building. It should be based on analysis and projections regarding \\nwork load, geographic and socioeconomic equity determinants for service delivery. Such a plan should \\nfirst set the baseline of current availability of the various health professionals, look at current training \\ncapacity and output, then develop projections of future needs, taking into account the current shift \\nfrom home deliveries without skilled attendants to home deliveries with SBA and to institutional \\ndeliveries, and be aware that the intermediate step may be bypassed due to rapidly changing care \\nseeking behaviors and provision of delivery services by the private sector. \\nSince recruitment and retention continue to present major challenges, the HR plan should cover \\ngender-sensitive employment, deployment, capacity building/training and incentives for working \\nin hard to reach areas, and take into account the rapid changes which are occurring in access to \\ninstitutional deliveries and the requirements of the health professionals needed at the various levels \\nof the system. \\nAnnex 2 and SOPs provide standards for staff requirements at different levels. On average, one UHC \\nper district would be required instead of current 159 UHCs for CEmONC to manage the remaining \\nnumber of obstetric cases and two EmONC pair have been recommended for those UHCs to provide \\n24/7 c-EmONC services. It would be more strategic to ensure availability and retention of EmOC pairs \\nin designated EmONC facilities.  MCWCs do not have a regular post of MO for anesthesia. MO-MCH \\nfrom sador upazila are attached at MCWC to provide anesthesia in addition to his/her normal function \\nin maternal, child health and family planning services.  The strategy recommends to create a regular \\nMO-Anesthesia post for MCWC. There is no provision of basic lab facility in MCWC and FWC. For MCWC, \\na basic lab should be set up to ensure routine blood and urine test. Hence, a new post for Medical \\nTechnologist (Lab) has been recommended. In order to ensure quality and immediate newborn care, \\neach CEmONC facility should have at least one consultant pediatrician and at least one medical officer \\ntrained on newborn care.'),\n",

Certified midwives will be available from 2015 onward, \\ncreating the need for ensuring funds for their employment.  \\nThe Government is implementing an accredited CSBA training since 2003 in both government (FWA \\nand female HA) and non-government sector, in order to deploy over 13000 CSBAs  in the country. \\nBangladesh Nursing Council certifies and registers the successful trainees to work as CSBAs to perform \\ndefined functions: counseling, antenatal care, safe delivery, newborn care and postnatal care.  To \\nimprove performance, all CSBAs will be supervised and supported with supplies and refresher trainings \\nunder a government supervisory framework. All public, NGO and private CSBAs will report through \\nthe respective FWVs to the upazila government system into the MIS.

Tools and protocols will also be developed to enable analysis and use of this data \\nat the local, regional and national levels. \\n4.4.2 Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR)\\nMPDSR is a non-blaming and non-punitive approach which fosters participation at all levels for \\nidentifying maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirths. DGHS and DGFP will coordinate to track \\nall maternal deaths in the country without gaps and duplications. Their joint effort will ensure \\nnotification and review of all maternal and newborn deaths. Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance \\nand Response, currently implemented in 22 districts by MOH&FW, UNICEF and other development \\npartners, and needs to be scaled in 64 districts. MPDSR helps program managers analyze factors \\ncontributing to the maternal death and identify solutions, by identifying the “causes of the causes” \\nthrough a systematic and participatory process. MPDSR involve all levels of health workforce from \\ncommunity and facility. Front line health workers including HAs and FWAs notify deaths at community \\nlevel. First line supervisor, Health Inspectors, Assistant Health Inspectors or FP Inspectors perform \\ndeath reviews. Facility based death reviews are undertaken jointly by facility health managers and \\nservice providers. Upazila and District MPDSR committees review information and develop appropriate \\nlocal actions. The field workers also conduct social autopsy at the community to prevent the next \\ndeath. The national guideline has been developed by the Health Economic Unit of MOH&FW for the \\nimplementation of MPDSR throughout the country. MPDSR data has been incorporated in web-based \\nDHIS-2 of Management Information System (MIS) of DGHS which is capturing real time information \\non every death. Every district need to develop a comprehensive action plan based data and need to \\nimplement to reduce the cause specific mortality.

A voucher entitles its holder to receive free maternal health care services including ANC \\nand PNC, safe delivery and treatment of complications (including caesarean sections and assisted \\nvaginal delivery) from designated facilities or skilled providers in the community. Service recipients \\nreceive cash incentives, transport subsidies, and a gift box. Service providers also receive incentives \\nto distribute vouchers and to provide services covered by the voucher scheme. DSF is to be seen as \\nan interim solution to increase facility delivery/ delivery by skilled attendants among the poorest. \\nThe MOHFW has recently started a community insurance scheme known as Shasthyo Shurokhsha \\nKarmasuchi (SSK) for ensuring universal access to health care by the poorest. There are also about \\nfifty social protection schemes to support the poorest administered by various ministries other than \\nministry of health. Limited coordination, poor governance and overlapping among these schemes \\nhave constrained comparative evaluation and transfer of intended benefits to the poorest women \\nand children, and need to be addressed. \\nTable: 5.1 Socio-economic inequity\\nStrategic Direction 2019-22 2023-26 2027-30\\nDevelop interim scale up plan for DSF schemes based on \\nreviews of current schemes\\nSelect the upazilas for DSF schemes and develop an exit plan \\nfor each of the selected upazilas\\nStrengthen the technical capacity of the DSF cell at local and \\nnational level'),\n",

The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) deceased from 322 maternal death per 100,000 \\nlive births in 2001 to 194 per 100,000 live births in 20101   and there is further reduction of MMR to 176 \\nper 100,000 live births in 2015 as per UN estimate2. While these improvements are impressive, the \\nreduction rate in maternal mortality is far less than the desired level of achieving the ambitious \\nSustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of MMR, 70/100,000 live births by 2030. This is likely to be \\ndue to stagnant modern contraceptive prevalence rates, limited quality of care and capacity to deal with \\nthe main causes of maternal death, and high caesarean section rates. There is not much change in the \\nmajor causes of maternal mortality over the last decade; major causes of maternal mortality are \\nhemorrhage (31%) and Eclampsia (24%)3.  \\nAchieving the desired mortality level needs accelerated efforts by the government and development \\npartners for rapid scale-up of high impact and cost-effective priority interventions and achieving the \\neffective coverage. Access to quality reproductive maternal, newborn, adolescent health care services \\nremains a challenge across all level of care and including equity among population subgroups. Evidence \\nalso suggests that increased coverage and quality of preconception, antenatal, intrapartum, and \\npostnatal interventions by 2025 could avert 71% of neonatal deaths, 33% of stillbirths and 54% of \\nmaternal deaths per year4.  \\nSubstantial increase was achieved in skilled attendance at deliveries, 4+ ANC and PNC coverage between \\n2014 and 2017 BDHS surveys5. However, there is gap between contact and content of ANC. The contact \\nis defined as the percentage of pregnant women with four or more antenatal care visits. The content of \\nANC is an essential component of service quality and defined as proportion of pregnant women who \\nsought ANC and receive all basic component of ANC including weight & blood pressure measured, urine \\n& blood tests and information on signs of possible pregnancy complications. BDHS 2017 data shows a \\nhuge gap between contact and content in the antenatal period. 47% of women received four or more \\nANC visits, whereas only 18% of the women received all ANC content or quality compoements5. There is \\nalso gap in coverage of this essential services among different geographic location6. The findings from a \\nstudy reveal that the coverage of antenatal care service remains critically low in Netrokona, a low \\nperforming district in Bangladesh. The findings also highlight that even when women attend ANC \\ncontacts, substantial gaps in content remain during these contacts. Therefore, women are not fully \\nbenefiting from these services7. \\nThere is increasing evidence to support that increased coverage of recommended contacts alone is \\ninsufficient to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity 4,8,9 ,12,13Quality of care is being \\ninternationally recognized as a critical aspect of the unfinished maternal and newborn health agenda8,10 \\nRecently, the World Health Organization has proposed standards of care and measures for assessing \\nquality of maternal and newborn health care. \\nThere is need to include elements of quality of care for regular monitoring through routine health \\nmanagement information systems, household and facility surveys in order to identify the real gaps in \\neffective coverage. Periodic program assessments can include a measure for content analysis of ANC \\nand PNC visits in a given sample of mothers and newborns and explore reasons of omitting certain \\ninterventions. Further research is also required to identify more sensitive indicators on quality of care \\nand including these in future household surveys.'),\n",

International study highlights that having \\nfour antenatal care visits and receiving better quality of antenatal care affected women's subsequent \\nuse of skilled birth attendant. The odds of having skilled birth attendant increases by 30 to 50% for \\nwomen who received blood pressure measurement, urine sample taken, and blood sample taken as part \\nof antenatal services11. The current maternal, newborn and child health coverage indicators for \\npregnancy, labour and postnatal period focus merely on contacts with the health system with no \\ninformation on quality and process of care. Focusing on merely contacts with health system rather than \\non content of care is a critical gap in assessing the true effectiveness of maternal and child health \\ninterventions. Such gaps between globally recommended coverage indicators measuring contacts and \\nactual content indicate ineffective care resulting in lack of accelerated progress towards maternal and \\nnewborn survival. To move towards elimination of preventable causes of maternal and newborn deaths, \\nincreased coverage of recommended contacts should be accompanied by increased focus on content of \\nservices8,10,12 \\nIn order to end preventable maternal deaths, accurate information on how many women died, where \\nthey died and how they died is essential, but is currently inadequate. It is essential to count every \\nmaternal and newborn death for understanding immediate and underlying causes of these deaths and \\ndeveloping evidence-informed, context-specific programme interventions to avert future deaths. As \\nutilization of health care services increases, many of the deaths are occurring at health facilities. The \\noutcome of care in health facilities reflects the evidence-based practices used and the overall quality of \\nservices provided. Poor-quality services and care reduce the effectiveness of interventions and increase \\nthe risks for hospital acquired infections, life-long disability and death from avoidable complications and \\npreventable causes. \\n \\nMaternal health is a top priority of the Government of Bangladesh and its Development Partners (DPs). \\nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare developed the National Strategy for Maternal Health 2019-2030, \\nwhich provide the strategic directions and guiding principles for maternal health programming and \\nimplementation in Bangladesh. The broad objective of the Bangladesh National Strategy for Maternal \\nHealth (BNSMH) 2019-2030 is to guide the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) in \\naddressing the existing gaps and inequities in the delivery of quality maternal health services as well as \\nthe social and development factors that impact on maternal health.  \\n \\nMOHFW initiate developing this National Action Plan for Maternal Health to accelerate the efforts in \\nreducing preventable maternal death by operationalizing the strategies and laying out a costed action \\nplan that can be implemented through their operational plans. \\n \\nIn this scenario, UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO, USAID and Save the Children supported the MOHFW in \\ndeveloping and finalizing the action plan through conducting wide stakeholder’s consultation and \\nparticipation. During the process, gap analysis was conducted to recommend appropriate actions \\naligning with Maternal health strategies, to address the gaps. It is expected that the action plan will be \\nincorporated into the respective operation plans for implementation. This action plan identifies some \\nkey priority actions that require urgent attention by the MOHFW and to accelerate implementation \\nimmediately. \\n \\nThe overall goal of Action plan for Maternal Health is to support the implementation of priority \\ninterventions that provides timely, equitable, accessible, high quality, evidence-based, respectful care in \\nan efficient and effective manner.\"),\n",

The administrative and clinical leaders \\nin maternal health identify gaps, issues of priorities and improvement opportunities in maternal health \\nand health care delivery system in order to improve the maternal care experience and overall health \\ncare system performance.  \\nIt provides an opportunity to engage key stakeholders including programme peoples, professionals, \\nacademia, NGO/private sectors, civil society in participatory discussions, stimulate national dialogue for \\npriority programme planning, accelerated effort to scale-up of equitable and sustained actions for \\nmaternal health and mobilize resources through ensuring commitment of government & development \\npartners and to achieve sustainable development goals.  \\nThis action Plan will respond to the global agenda of ending preventable maternal deaths, and is \\nconsistent with the global and national goals and approaches in maternal health under the overarching \\ncommitment of achieving sustainable goal 3 \\nThis action plan is for ten years in consistent with the National Maternal Health Strategy. However, it \\nneeds periodic review considering the changes occurring in key social and economic dimensions such as \\nurbanization, women’s education, employment and status, income growth that are rapidly modifying \\nreproductive and maternal health care- seeking behaviors with important implications for the planning \\nof health services, the availability of new evidences and also lessons learned from implementation of the \\naction plan. \\nDevelopment Process of National Action Plan for Maternal Health \\n \\n• Formation of National Core Committee and five Technical Sub-Committees in December 2019 \\nfor development of an action plan based on Bangladesh National Strategy for Maternal Health \\n2019-2030.  \\n• Under the guidance of National Core Committee, five Technical Subcommittees were assigned \\nto work in five following thematic areas; \\ni. Preconception, Antenatal care, Maternal Nutrition \\nii. Normal delivery, Basic Emergency Obstetric & Newborn Care (BEmONC), \\nComprehensive Emergency Obstetric & Newborn Care (CEmONC), Midwifery care \\niii.

The application of provider-population ratio, doesn’t match the \\nchanging human resource needs of health care organizations. Institutional staffing norms based \\nsolely on population or institutional size do not adequately take into consideration these \\nvariations of need within a country. This create real problems in health service provision, not \\nonly through under- or over-provision of health service staff but also through the inappropriate \\nallocation of different cadres of staff. In the developing world there has been continued difficulty \\nin ensuring an adequate and appropriate distribution of health service providers to deliver both \\npreventive and curative health services equitably across a country. Public sector health services \\nare, as a consequence, experiencing new pressures to improve the quality, quantity and \\naccessibility of the services they provide. To meet this emerging necessity, Bangladesh \\ngovernment recruited thousands of doctors, nurses, midwives and other cadres during the last \\ndecade in the public sector. Midwifes are the new cadre recruited and deployed in the recent \\nyears to the upazilla health complexes to provide maternal health care. \\n \\nThis inevitably leads to a closer examination of the basis on which staff are distributed \\nthroughout the health service and how they can be used more efficiently and effectively in \\nraising the health of the population as a whole. One significant development in this has been \\nincreased attention to monitoring performance and efficiency in the constituent organisations of \\nthe health service. Allied to these is the need to change the roles that different cadres of \\nprovider discharge, emerging in part from new views of health professional roles, partly through \\na changing technology for health interventions and partly through a requirement for greater skills \\nin the workforce to meet the growing public expectation. \\n \\nRightsizing is the act of paring down a workforce and reorganizing management to find the \\noptimum staffing level for increased cost-efficiency and productivity. Understanding rightsizing'),\n",

It delivers \\nhealth services through its nationwide infrastructure by employing doctors, nurses, midwives, \\npharmacists and a huge number of auxiliary health workers. The public healthcare services are \\norganized along four levels: community level healthcare (provided by the domiciliary health \\nproviders and community clinics), primary level healthcare (provided in Rural Health Centers, \\nUnion Subcenters, Union Health & Family Welfare Centers, and Upazila Health Complexes), \\nsecondary level healthcare (provided in District Hospitals, General Hospitals, Chest Disease \\nClinics, Tuberculosis Clinics, and Leprosy Hospitals), and tertiary level healthcare (provided in \\nPost Graduate Medical Universities, Specialized Hospitals, Medical College Hospitals). Ministry \\nof Health and Family Welfare recruit doctors, nurses, midwives centrally and deploy to fill up the \\nvacancies. Availability of posts (for different cadre of health care providers) at the different level \\nof health care facilities are proportionate to the number of beds available. Retention and \\nabsenteeism are two major problems in rural and hard to reach areas. \\nMaternal health intervention packages at different level of the health system (community clinic, \\noutreach, Union level facilities, UHC, DH and specialized hospitals) are clearly spelled out in the \\nMaternal Health Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), Volume1 and Bangladesh National \\nStrategy for Maternal Health 2019-2030, Annex 1. \\nPurpose: \\nThis report examines the expected number of deliveries (one of the key maternal health \\nintervention) at a upazilla in a year and to understand the requirement of health care \\nproviders(doctor, nurse, midwife) with right skills to deliver quality care in a upazilla health \\ncomplex, to increase the number of deliveries in these facilities (in alignment with national \\nmaternal health strategy) to achieve the national target of institutional deliveries. It is anticipated \\nthat the report will generate stimulating discussion amongst all stakeholders working in the \\nmaternal health arena. \\n \\nMethodology: \\n \\nUpazilla health complex are identified for conduction of normal deliveries and other basic \\nemergency obstetric and newborn care, whereas district hospitals, medical college hospitals \\nand other specialized hospitals are expected to manage the complicated cases including \\ncomprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care.

Y et, \\nduring this period, the burden of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity remains unacceptably high, and \\nopportunities to increase maternal well-being and to support nurturing newborn care have not been fully utilized. \\nPostnatal care services are a fundamental component of the continuum of maternal, newborn and child care, \\nand key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on reproductive, maternal and child health, \\nincluding targets to reduce maternal mortality rates and end preventable deaths of newborns. \\nIn line with the SDGs and the Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health, and in \\naccordance with a human rights-based approach, postnatal care efforts must expand beyond coverage and \\nsurvival alone to include quality of care. This guideline aims to improve the quality of essential, routine postnatal \\ncare for women and newborns with the ultimate goal of improving maternal and newborn health and well-being. \\nIt recognizes a “positive postnatal experience” as a significant end point for all women giving birth and their \\nnewborns, laying the platform for improved short- and long-term health and well-being. A positive postnatal \\nexperience is defined as one in which women, newborns, partners, parents, caregivers and families receive \\ninformation, reassurance and support in a consistent manner from motivated health workers; where a resourced \\nand flexible health system recognizes the needs of women and babies, and respects their cultural context. \\nThis is a consolidated guideline of new and existing recommendations on routine postnatal care for women \\nand newborns receiving facility- or community-based postnatal care in any resource setting. It provides a \\ncomprehensive set of recommendations for care during the postnatal period, focusing on the essential package \\nthat all women and newborns should receive, with due attention to quality of care; that is, the provision and \\nexperience of care. This guideline updates and expands upon the 2014 WHO recommendations on postnatal \\ncare of the mother and newborn, and complements existing WHO guidelines on the management of postnatal \\ncomplications. \\nT arget audience\\nThe recommendations in this guideline are intended to inform the development of relevant national and \\nsubnational health policies, clinical protocols and programmatic guides. Therefore, the target audience includes \\nnational and subnational public health policy-makers, implementers and managers of maternal, newborn and \\nchild health programmes, health facility managers, health workers (including midwives, auxiliary nurse-midwives, \\nnurses, obstetricians, paediatricians, neonatologists, general medical practitioners and community health \\nworkers), nongovernmental organizations, professional societies involved in the planning and management of \\nmaternal, newborn and child health services, academic staff involved in training health workers, and women’s and \\nparents’ groups. \\nThe terms woman, mother, partner, parents and caregivers have been used throughout this guideline. These \\nterms have been defined in an attempt to promote inclusivity of all individuals who have given birth, and in \\nrecognition of the diverse roles of all individuals involved in providing care and support during the postnatal \\nperiod.\"),\n",

Briefly, these procedures include: (i) identification of priority \\nquestions and outcomes; (ii) evidence retrieval and synthesis; (iii) assessment of the evidence; (iv) formulation \\nof recommendations; and (v) planning for implementation, dissemination, impact evaluation and updating of the \\nguideline. The quality of the scientific evidence underpinning the recommendations was graded using the Grading \\nof Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and Confidence in the Evidence from \\nReviews of Qualitative research (CERQual) approaches for quantitative and qualitative evidence, respectively. \\nFindings from individual cost-effectiveness studies were assessed using the Consensus Health Economic Criteria \\n(CHEC) checklist. The DECIDE framework (Developing and Evaluating Communication Strategies to Support \\nInformed Decisions and Practice Based on Evidence), an evidence-to-decision tool, was used to guide the \\ncompilation of evidence, judgements on the different criteria, and the formulation of recommendations by the \\nGuideline Development Group (GDG), including: the effects of an intervention on maternal, newborn and health \\nsystems outcomes, and considerations around values of women, parents and health workers; resources; equity; \\nacceptability; and the feasibility of the interventions. The GDG is an international group of experts assembled \\nfor the purpose of developing this guideline – at nine virtual GDG meetings held between September 2020 and \\nJune 2021. In addition, existing recommendations from current Guideline Review Committee-approved WHO \\nguidelines that were relevant to postnatal care were identified and integrated into this guideline for the purpose \\nof providing a comprehensive document for end-users. \\nRecommendations\\nThe GDG meetings led to 63 recommendations to improve provision, utilization and experience of postnatal \\ncare: 31 are newly developed GDG recommendations and 32 are recommendations integrated from existing \\nWHO guidelines. Recommendations are grouped according to maternal care, newborn care, and health systems \\nand health promotion interventions. Interventions were classified as recommended, not recommended, or \\nrecommended under certain conditions based on the GDG’s judgements according to the DECIDE criteria, \\nwhich informed the direction and category of the recommendation. Where the GDG recommended or did not \\nrecommend an intervention, the resulting recommendation is relevant to all women in the postpartum period and \\nnewborns, unless otherwise indicated in the recommendation. Where the GDG recommended an intervention \\nonly in specific contexts, it judged the evidence to be applicable only to these situations, settings or populations. \\nFor all recommendations, the GDG provided remarks, including additional contextual information relating to \\ncontext-specific recommendations, where needed. Users of the guideline should refer to these remarks, which \\nare presented along with the evidence summaries in the full version of the guideline.'),\n",

This current guideline confirms the importance of postnatal care during the first 24 \\nhours after birth, regardless of the place of birth.

Introduction \\n1\\n1. Introduction\\n1.1 Background\\nGlobal strategies, including the Global Strategy \\nfor Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health \\n(2016–2030) (1), Strategies toward Ending Preventable \\nMaternal Mortality (2), the Every Newborn Action Plan \\n(3) and other initiatives (4, 5) recognize the postnatal \\nperiod, defined here as beginning immediately after \\nthe birth of the baby and extending up to six weeks \\n(42 days) after birth (6), as a critical time for women \\nand newborns, partners, parents, caregivers and \\nfamilies. Despite these efforts, the burden of maternal \\nand neonatal mortality and morbidity in the postnatal \\nperiod is still high (7, 8). Up to 30% of maternal deaths \\noccur postpartum (8). Infants face a high risk of dying \\nin their first month after birth, with an average global \\nrate of 17 deaths per 1000 live births in 2019 (9, 10). \\nY et coverage and quality of postnatal care for \\nwomen and newborns tend to be relatively poor, and \\nopportunities to increase well-being and support \\nnurturing newborn care are lost. Length of stay in the \\nhealth facility after birth varies widely across countries \\nand substantial proportions of women and newborns \\nreceive inadequate postnatal care during the first \\n24\\xa0hours after childbirth (11). The median coverage \\nfor routine postnatal care within two days after birth \\nfor women (71%) and newborns (64%) (12) still lags \\nbehind global targets for 2025 (13). \\nIn line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \\n(14) and the Global Strategy for Women Children and \\nAdolescent Health (1), the focus of the global agendas \\nhas now expanded beyond maternal and newborn \\nsurvival, to also ensure that women and babies thrive \\nand achieve their full potential for health and well-be-\\ning, in accordance with a human rights-based approach. \\nQuality of care throughout the pregnancy, childbirth \\nand the postnatal periods is critical to the operationali-\\nzation of these global agendas and the achievement of \\nthe health-related SDGs. \\nPostnatal care services are a fundamental component \\nof this continuum. These services provide the platform \\nfor the care of women after childbirth and newborns, \\nincluding the promotion of healthy practices, disease \\nprevention, and detection and management of \\nproblems during the first six weeks after birth. Postnatal \\ncare aims at maintaining and promoting the health \\nand well-being of women and children from birth, and \\nfostering an environment that offers help and support \\nto women, parents, caregivers and families for a wide \\nrange of health, social and developmental needs. \\nWHO published recommendations on postnatal care \\nfor mothers and newborns in 2014 (15). However, in \\nview of new recommendations from different WHO \\ndepartments published after 2014 and the availability \\nof new evidence related to the organization of care \\nand interventions for better quality postnatal care, \\nit is important that recommendations for postnatal \\ncare are reviewed, updated and consolidated \\naccordingly. This guideline consolidates current \\nguidance for effective and safe clinical and non-clinical \\ninterventions, as well as health systems and health \\npromotion interventions for essential care during the \\npostnatal period, to improve the quality (provision \\nand experience) of postnatal care for women \\nand newborns. It recognizes a “positive postnatal \\nexperience” as a significant end point for all women \\ngiving birth and their newborns, laying the platform for \\nimproved short- and long-term health and well-being. \\nA positive postnatal experience is defined as one in \\nwhich women, newborns, partners, parents, caregivers \\nand families receive information and reassurance \\ndelivered in a consistent manner by motivated health \\nworkers. Both the women’s and babies’ needs are \\nrecognized, within a resourced and flexible health \\nsystem that respects their cultural context.\\n1.2 T arget audience\\nThe recommendations in this guideline are intended \\nto inform the development of relevant national \\nand subnational health policies, clinical protocols \\nand programmatic guides. Therefore, the target \\naudience includes national and subnational public \\nhealth policy-makers, implementers and managers \\nof maternal, newborn and child health programmes, \\nhealth facility managers, health workers (including \\nmidwives, auxiliary nurse-midwives, nurses, \\nobstetricians, paediatricians, neonatologists, general \\nmedical practitioners, community health workers), \\nnongovernmental organizations, professional \\nsocieties involved in the planning and management'),\n",

Based on the premise that all women \\nand newborns deserve high-quality care, the guideline \\nfocuses on the core, essential postnatal care package. \\nFor the purpose of this guideline, the term “healthy \\nwomen and newborns” is used to describe women or \\nadolescent girls after childbirth and their newborns \\nwho have no apparent risk factors or illness, and who \\notherwise appear to be healthy. Some women and their \\nnewborns can have additional health and social needs \\nthat are not covered in this guideline, including in the \\ncase of death of the woman or baby. Individuals with \\nadditional needs may also include adolescent girls and \\nthose from priority groups, including, among others, \\nthose living in rural settings, those facing financial \\nhardship, those from ethnic, religious and racial \\nminorities, migrant and displaced or war-affected \\nindividuals, unmarried women and girls, survivors of \\nsexual- and gender-based violence, surrogates, sex \\nworkers, transgender or nonbinary individuals, those \\nwith disabilities or mental health conditions, and those \\nliving with HIV. Additional management of women or \\nnewborns who develop complications in the postnatal \\nperiod, those with high-risk pregnancies, those who \\npresented with complications during labour and \\nchildbirth, or who require specialized postnatal care, \\nare also not included in this guideline.\\nThis guideline is therefore complementary to existing \\nWHO guidance on the immediate care of the woman \\nand newborn after birth, management of complications \\nduring pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal \\nperiod and care of preterm and low birthweight \\ninfant. T ogether with the WHO recommendations on \\nantenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience \\n(16) and the WHO recommendations on intrapartum \\ncare for a positive childbirth experience (17), WHO \\nhas provided a set of integrated recommendations \\nto address quality essential respectful care along the \\npregnancy to postnatal continuum. \\nThis is a consolidated guideline of new and existing \\nWHO recommendations on postnatal care for women \\nand newborns receiving facility- or community-based \\npostnatal care in any resource setting. It provides a \\ncomprehensive set of recommendations for care during \\nthe postnatal period, focusing on the essential package \\nthat all women and newborns should receive, paying \\ndue attention to quality of care. This guideline updates \\nand expands upon the 2014 WHO recommendations \\non postnatal care of the mother and newborn (15), \\nand complements existing WHO guidelines on the \\nmanagement of postnatal complications. \\nThe priority questions and outcomes that guided \\nevidence synthesis and decision-making for this \\nguideline are listed in Web Annex\\xa01 and cover \\nessential care that should be provided during the \\npostnatal care period, including maternal and \\nnewborn assessments, interventions for common \\nphysiological symptoms, preventive measures, \\nmaternal mental health assessment and interventions, \\ncontraception, nutritional interventions, infant growth \\nand development, breastfeeding, health systems, and \\nhealth promotion interventions (to improve provision, \\nutilization and experience of postnatal care). The \\npriority questions and outcomes for existing WHO \\nrecommendations that have been integrated into this \\nguideline can be found in the respective guidelines. \\nThe terms woman, mother, partner, parents and \\ncaregivers have been used in different combinations \\nthroughout the guideline. The terms “woman” or \\n“mother” include individuals who have given birth, \\neven if they may not identify as a woman or as a \\nmother. T o be concise and to facilitate readability, \\nthe term “woman” is generally used, but sometimes \\n“mother” is used when referring to the woman in \\nrelation to her newborn. It is recognized that there \\nare those who have given birth, but identify as gender \\ndiverse individuals. Also, different types of couples and \\nfamilies exist. The term “partner” is used to refer to \\nthe woman’s chosen supporter, such as the woman’s \\npartner, spouse/husband and/ or the baby’s father. The \\nterm “parents” refers to those responsible for caring \\nfor the newborn. This will often be the mother and \\nthe father, but may include single parents, co-parents, \\nsame sex parents or parents with gender diverse \\nidentities. The term “caregiver” recognizes the different \\npersons or family members who may be responsible \\nfor the care of the newborn. Families can be an \\nimportant support for women and parents and have a \\nvital role in maternal and newborn health. For brevity, \\nwe have not mentioned these term consistently \\nthroughout the document (18).'),\n",

The \\ngroup drafted the initial scope of the guideline, \\nidentified priority questions and outcomes, prepared \\nthe guideline planning proposal, and identified \\nsystematic review teams, guideline methodologists \\nand members of the Guideline Development \\nGroup (GDG). Additionally, the Steering Group \\nsupervised the evidence retrieval, assessment and \\nsynthesis, organized the GDG meetings, prepared \\ndraft recommendations for the GDG and the final \\ndocument, and managed the guideline publication \\nand dissemination.\\n2.1.2 Guideline Development Group \\nThe WHO Steering Group identified 21 external \\nexperts and stakeholders from the six WHO regions to \\nform the GDG. This was a diverse group of individuals \\nwith expertise in research, clinical practice, policy and \\nprogrammes, guideline development methods relating \\nto postnatal care practices and service delivery, and \\npatient/ consumer representatives. The members \\nwere identified in a way that ensured geographic \\nrepresentation and gender balance with no important \\nconflicts of interest. \\nSelected members of this group participated in a \\nscoping meeting held in April 2019 and provided \\ninput into the priority questions and outcomes that \\nguided the evidence reviews. The GDG examined \\nand interpreted the evidence and formulated the final \\nrecommendations at nine virtual meetings between \\nSeptember 2020 and June 2021. The group also \\nreviewed and approved the final guideline document.\\n2.1.3 External Review Group \\nThis group included six technical experts and \\nstakeholders with an interest in the provision and \\nexperience of evidence-based postnatal care. The \\ngroup was geographically balanced and gender-\\nrepresentative, and had no important conflicts of \\ninterest. The External Review Group (ERG) peer-\\nreviewed the final document to identify any errors of \\nfact and comment on clarity of language, contextual \\nissues and implications for implementation. The \\ngroup ensured that the guideline decision-making \\nprocesses considered and incorporated the \\ncontextual values and preferences of persons affected \\nby the recommendations, including postpartum \\nwomen, partners, newborns, parents, caregivers and \\nfamilies, health workers and managers, and policy-\\nmakers.

From the priority \\nquestions identified, the associated interventions were \\nthen classified according to the WHO quality of care \\nframework (20) and the nurturing care framework \\n(5) to ensure the recommendations would respond \\nto a maximum of domains, including: quality of care \\n(provision and experience of care); nurturing care \\n(health, nutrition, security and safety, responsive \\ncaregiving and early learning); and strengthening \\nhealth systems. Changes from the approved scope of \\nthis guideline and the reasons for such changes are \\ndescribed in Web Annex 2. \\nDiscussion of the key thematic areas for essential, \\nroutine postnatal care took account of interventions \\nthat are already covered in existing WHO guidelines. \\nConsidering available resources, the group agreed \\nto limit the scope of prioritized questions to those \\nnot addressed by existing WHO guidelines or those \\nidentified for update, with the caveat that existing \\nrecommendations (that were developed according to \\nWHO standard procedures) would be integrated into \\nthe final guideline document (see section\\xa02.3). \\nIn determining the guideline focus, the scoping \\nprocess highlighted the need to identify person-\\ncentred interventions and outcomes for postnatal \\ncare. T o this end, a qualitative evidence synthesis \\nwas conducted to understand what women \\nwant, need and value during the postnatal period \\n(21). The findings of this review suggest that the \\npostnatal phase is a period of significant transition \\ncharacterized by changes in self-identity, the \\nredefinition of relationships, opportunities for \\npersonal growth, and alterations to sexual behaviour \\nas women adjust to their new normal, both as parents \\nand as individuals within their own cultural context. \\nFor many women, it is also marked by feelings of \\nintense joy, happiness and love for the new baby. \\nThe definition of a positive postnatal experience \\nhas therefore been adapted to also consider the \\nexperience of newborns, parents and the family more \\nbroadly (Box 2.1).\\nBased on the prioritization exercise described \\nabove, a set of outcomes that were considered as \\ncritical or as important to women and newborns was \\nprioritized for the postnatal period (Web Annex 1). \\nFurthermore, due to important differences between \\nthe types of prioritized interventions and the range \\nof potential outcomes, and with due consideration \\nof what matters to women, parents and caregivers in \\nthe postnatal period, the outcomes were prioritized \\nseparately for individual guideline questions. \\nInformed initially by the qualitative review of women’s \\nviews, the list of outcomes was complemented by \\noutcomes related to maternal and family functioning, \\nwell-being and experience of postnatal care; it \\nBox 2.1 Positive postnatal experience \\nA positive postnatal experience is defined as one \\nin which women, partners, parents, caregivers and \\nfamilies receive information and reassurance in a \\nconsistent manner from motivated health workers. \\nBoth the women’s and babies’ health, social and \\ndevelopmental needs are recognized, within a \\nresourced and flexible health system that respects \\ntheir cultural context.\\nAdapted from Finlayson et al.

One review used the \\nCASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme).\\n27\\nStudies identified for the qualitative reviews related \\nto what women want from postnatal care and \\nto women’s experiences of postnatal care were \\nsubjected to a simple, quality appraisal system using \\na validated instrument that rated studies against 11 \\npre-defined criteria, and then allocated a score from \\nA to D, with D indicating the presence of significant \\nflaws that are very likely to affect the credibility, \\ntransferability, dependability and/ or confirmability \\nof the study (33). The other qualitative reviews used \\nCASP or a modified CASP. \\n2.6.2 Grading of the review evidence\\nThe GRADE approach to appraising the certainty of \\nquantitative evidence (25) was used for all the critical \\noutcomes identified in the PICO questions. For every \\npriority question, a GRADE evidence profile was \\nprepared for each quantitative outcome. Accordingly, \\nthe certainty of evidence for each outcome was rated \\nas “high”, “moderate”, “low” or “very low” based on \\na set of criteria. As a baseline, RCT s provided “high-\\ncertainty” evidence, while non-randomized trials \\nand observational studies provided “low-certainty” \\nevidence. This baseline certainty rating was then \\ndowngraded based on consideration of study design \\nlimitations (risk of bias), inconsistency, imprecision, \\nindirectness and publication bias. For observational \\nstudies, other considerations, such as magnitude \\nof effect, could lead to upgrading of the rating if \\nthere were no limitations that indicated a need for \\n27 C ASP critical appraisal tools are available at: https:/ / casp-uk.\\nnet/ casp-tools-checklists/.\\ndowngrading.

The GRADE-CERQual tool, which uses a \\nsimilar approach conceptually to other GRADE tools, \\nprovides a transparent method for assessing and \\nassigning the level of confidence that can be placed \\nin evidence from reviews of qualitative research. \\nThe confidence in qualitative review findings were \\nassigned to evidence domains on values, acceptability \\nand feasibility according to four components: \\nmethodological limitations of the individual studies, \\nadequacy of data, coherence, and relevance to the \\nreview question of the individual studies contributing \\nto a review finding. \\nFindings from individual cost-effectiveness studies \\nwere reported narratively for each comparison of \\ninterest, and evidence was assessed using the CHEC \\nchecklist (27).\\n2.7 Formulation of the \\nrecommendations\\nThe WHO Steering Group supervised and finalized \\nthe preparation of evidence profiles and evidence \\nsummaries in collaboration with the TWG using \\nthe GRADE DECIDE (Developing and Evaluating \\nCommunication Strategies to Support Informed \\nDecisions and Practice Based on Evidence) EtD \\nframework.

Where \\nbenefits clearly outweighed harms for outcomes \\nthat are highly valued by pregnant women, or \\nvice versa, there was a greater likelihood of \\na clear judgement in favour of or against the \\nintervention, respectively. Uncertainty about the \\nnet benefits or harms, and small net benefits, most \\nlikely led to a judgement that neither favoured \\nthe intervention nor the comparator. The higher \\nthe certainty of evidence on benefits across \\noutcomes, the higher the likelihood of a judgement \\nin favour of the intervention.

Blood pressure should be measured shortly after birth. If normal, the second blood pressure \\nmeasurement should be taken within 6 hours. Urine void should be documented within 6 hours.\\nAt each subsequent postnatal contact beyond 24 hours after birth, enquiries should continue to be \\nmade about general well-being and assessments made regarding the following: micturition and urinary \\nincontinence, bowel function, healing of any perineal wound, headache, fatigue, back pain, perineal pain \\nand perineal hygiene, breast pain and uterine tenderness and lochia.

These changes \\nlead to a variety of common symptoms, including \\npain and discomfort, which can negatively affect a \\nwoman’s postnatal experience. \\nThe GDG considered the evidence and other relevant \\ninformation to inform recommendations relating \\nto non-pharmacological and/ or pharmacological \\ntreatments for relieving perineal pain, uterine \\ncramping/involution pain, urinary and faecal \\nincontinence, and breast engorgement. \\nPerineal and uterine cramping/involution \\npain\\nPerineal pain is a common symptom in the short and \\nlong term after vaginal birth (44). Pain may result \\nfrom perineal trauma or present among women with \\nan intact perineum. This pain can negatively impact \\nwomen’s social and emotional well-being as a result \\nof decreased mobility, discomfort and difficulty \\nwith passing urine or faeces, and interfere with their \\nability to care for their newborns and to establish \\nbreastfeeding. A variety of non-pharmacological \\nmethods for the relief of perineal pain have been \\nproposed as alternatives or additional treatments to \\npharmacological interventions. Cooling is one of the \\nmost commonly used non-pharmacological methods \\nto relieve perineal pain (45), including: (i)\\xa0solid \\nor crushed ice applied directly to the perineum \\nor between layers of a pad; (ii)\\xa0a gel pack applied \\nto the perineum; or (iii)\\xa0bathing. Pharmacological \\nanalgesics to relieve postpartum perineal pain include \\noral and rectal analgesics, and topically applied \\nlocal analgesics (either as gel, ointments or sprays). \\nOral analgesics are the most common mode of \\nadministration of perineal pain relief. These include \\nparacetamol, aspirin, and oral non-steroidal anti-\\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \\nUterine involution is where women experience \\ncramping pain (often called after birth pains) and \\ndiscomfort caused by involution of the uterus for \\ntwo to three days after childbirth, as the uterus \\ncontracts and returns to its pre-pregnancy size \\n(46). Pharmacological analgesics to relieve uterine \\ncramping pain usually include paracetamol, NSAIDs \\n(e.g. aspirin and naproxen) and opioids (e.g. \\ncodeine) (46).\\nUrinary and faecal incontinence\\nUrinary and faecal incontinence refers to the \\ninvoluntary leakage of urine and faeces, respectively. \\nApproximately one third of women experience \\nurinary incontinence in the first three months after \\nchildbirth, which then gradually decreases during \\nthe first postpartum year (47). Both urinary and \\nfaecal incontinence can have a significant impact on \\nquality of life, which may persist for years. Pelvic floor \\nmuscle training (PFMT) includes one or more daily \\nsets of repeated voluntary contractions of the pelvic \\nfloor muscles, several days per week, for a variable \\nperiod during pregnancy or the postpartum period \\nto strengthen the pelvic floor muscles (48). PFMT \\nis mainly proposed to prevent urine or stool leakage \\nin women who are continent, or as a supervised \\ntreatment for women developing symptoms of \\nincontinence during pregnancy or the puerperium. \\nPFMT could also improve sexual function and other \\npelvic floor disorders in postnatal women, including \\nfaecal incontinence and pelvic floor prolapse.\\nBreast engorgement \\nBreast engorgement is the pathological overfilling of \\nthe breasts with milk, characterized by hard, painful, \\ntight breasts and difficult breastfeeding (49). It is \\nusually due to compromised milk removal, either \\nfrom separation of mother and baby, restrictive \\nfeeding practices and/ or ineffective sucking or, \\nless commonly, overproduction of milk. Breast \\nengorgement affects between 15% and 50% of \\nwomen (49) and may lead to mastitis. As lactation \\ncomplications such as mastitis are the main reasons \\ncited for early weaning, interventions that alleviate \\nproblems related to breastfeeding may help with \\nbreastfeeding continuation (50).\\nInterventions for treatment of breast engorgement \\nshould aim to: (i)\\xa0provide rapid relief of breast pain; \\n(ii)\\xa0enable successful attachment of the baby to the \\nbreast; (iii)\\xa0facilitate efficient drainage of milk from \\nthe breasts; and (iv)\\xa0prevent known complications \\nsuch as mastitis and breast abscesses (49). Non-\\npharmacological interventions include applying moist \\nheat to the breast prior to feeding to aid oxytocin'),\n",

These non-pharmacological interventions \\nare sometimes coupled with analgesics (e.g. \\nparacetamol) and anti-inflammatory medication \\n(e.g. ibuprofen) if needed. Other pharmacological \\ninterventions include the use of oxytocin, protease \\nor serrapeptase. Oxytocin (subcutaneous, oral or \\nnasal sprays) may induce the milk-ejection reflex. \\nEnzyme therapy is believed to be able to suppress \\ninflammation, abate and alleviate pain and oedema, \\nand accelerate the circulation of blood and lymph. \\nBox 3.1 Values\\nFindings from a qualitative evidence synthesis \\nexploring what women want from postnatal \\ncare (21) indicate that women want a positive \\nexperience in which they are able to adapt to \\ntheir new self-identity and develop a sense of \\nconfidence and competence as a mother. They also \\nwant to adjust to changes in their intimate and \\nfamily relationships (including their relationship \\nto their baby), navigate ordinary physical and \\nemotional challenges, and experience the \\ndynamic achievement of personal growth as \\nthey adjust to their new normal, both as parents \\nand as individuals in their own cultural context. \\nWomen often feel unprepared for the physical and \\npsychological effects of labour and birth-induced \\ntrauma and the impact this has on their ability \\nto provide appropriate care for their baby (and \\nother children). Women experience feelings of \\nfear and anxiety associated with the long-term \\nmanagement of caesarean birth wounds, perineal \\ndamage, bladder problems, vaginal bleeding and \\ngeneral discomfort. Some women would like more \\ninformation from health workers about how to \\nsoothe/treat physical injuries, and some would \\nwelcome the opportunity to discuss their labour \\nand birth with a health worker (high confidence \\nin the evidence). Highlighted in the review was \\nthe importance women place on breastfeeding \\nas a medium for establishing a relationship with \\ntheir baby (moderate confidence in the evidence) \\nand the unanticipated challenges they sometimes \\nexperience when breastfeeding is difficult or \\npainful (moderate confidence in the evidence). \\nThe review findings suggest that women would \\nwelcome any additional support, information and, \\nwhere appropriate, treatment (pharmacological \\nor non-pharmacological) to facilitate successful \\nbreastfeeding (high confidence in the evidence).\\nBox 3.3 Feasibility of interventions\\nA qualitative evidence synthesis of women’s \\nexperiences of postnatal care found no direct \\nevidence relating to women’s views on the \\nfeasibility of the interventions evaluated to treat \\ncommon physiological signs and symptoms in \\nthe postnatal period (28). Likewise, a qualitative \\nevidence synthesis of health workers’ experiences \\nof postnatal care found no direct evidence relating \\nto views on the feasibility of these interventions \\n(29). Indirect evidence from the latter review \\nsuggests that lack of personnel, resources and \\ntraining may limit the offer of interventions to treat \\nthe common physiological signs and symptoms \\naddressed, including provision of information and \\ncounselling related to these issues (moderate \\nconfidence in the evidence). Indirect evidence \\nfrom the same review indicates that some women \\nin low- and middle-income countries may be \\nless likely to seek help for issues such as breast \\nengorgement if they perceive that health facilities \\nlack the resources to offer appropriate treatments \\nor if they believe that treatment will incur additional \\ncosts (moderate confidence in the evidence). The \\nlack of continuity of care and common policies \\nor guidelines across different cadres and levels \\nof maternal health services may limit the offer \\nof consistent information and breastfeeding \\ncounselling (moderate confidence in the evidence).\\nBox 3.2 Acceptability of interventions\\nA qualitative evidence synthesis of women’s \\nexperiences of postnatal care found no direct \\nevidence relating to women’s views on the \\ninterventions evaluated to treat common \\nphysiological signs and symptoms in the postnatal \\nperiod (28). Indirect evidence from this review \\nsuggests that women appreciate any techniques \\nor treatments to enhance comfort, mobility, \\nsexual relations and psychosocial well-being (high \\nconfidence in the evidence). Findings from the \\nsame review also indicate that, in some contexts, \\nwomen may prefer to use traditional practices to \\ntreat common physiological signs and symptoms \\n(moderate confidence in the evidence). Women \\nwould like more information about potential \\nchildbirth complications (highlighted during the \\nantenatal phase) and the steps they can take to \\navoid these problems (high confidence in the \\nevidence)'),\n",

(Recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• The evidence reviewed included intermittent application of local cooling in the form of crushed ice \\nbetween layers of a pad, or a gel pack, for 10 to 20 minutes in a single application to multiple applications \\nin the first 48 hours after childbirth. \\n• In making this recommendation, the Guideline Development Group agreed that perineal pain relief should \\nbe individualized, considering the presence of perineal trauma, intensity of the pain, multiple sources of \\npostpartum pain (e.g. perineal, uterine, breast pain) and the use of other forms of pain relief. Local cooling \\nis low cost and unlikely to cause harmful effects if performed as instructed, and some women find it to be \\nsoothing.\\n• Non-pharmacological pain relief options can vary widely across settings and contexts, which might \\nfavour other non-pharmacological pain relief interventions and traditional and complementary medicine \\nthat were not evaluated during the guideline process, such as sitz baths, acupuncture or acupressure, \\naromatherapy, music, relaxation techniques, therapeutic ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve \\nstimulation (TENS) and laser therapy. \\n• All women should be asked about perineal pain and other perineal conditions (e.g. perineal trauma \\nhealing and haemorrhoids) during their postpartum stay in health facilities and at each postnatal care \\ncontact. Women should be advised on danger signs and symptoms, including any exacerbation of \\nperineal pain as a manifestation of postpartum complications such as haematomas, haemorrhoids and \\ninfection.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of the interventions (EB T able A.2.1) \\nEvidence was derived from an updated Cochrane \\nsystematic review on local cooling for relieving pain \\nfrom perineal trauma sustained during childbirth \\n(45). As the review was focused on local cooling \\ntechniques, non-pharmacological interventions other \\nthan local cooling have not been included in this \\nevidence summary. \\nThe review captured women who had sustained \\nnon-severe perineal trauma due to episiotomy or \\nfirst- or second-degree tears. Women who sustained \\nthird- or fourth-degree tears were not included, \\nand nor were women with an intact perineum. The \\nreview included 10 trials (1258 women), of which 8 \\ntrials (1182 women) contributed data. The included \\ntrials were published between 2000 and 2017, and \\nwere all conducted in hospital settings in Brazil \\n(3), the Islamic Republic of Iran (1), Thailand (1), \\nT urkey (1) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain \\nand Northern Ireland (2). One trial evaluating iced \\nsitz baths versus no intervention (60 women) did \\nnot present outcome data in a format that could be \\nincluded in the systematic review. In a small pilot trial \\n(16 women), regular application of ice packs with \\ncompression (pressure) and the horizontal position \\nof the mother was compared with ad hoc application \\nof ice packs (alone), thus results of this trial were not \\nconsidered in this framework. \\nT wo comparisons are presented below: (1) perineal \\nlocal cooling compared with no pain relief or usual \\ncare, and (2) perineal local cooling compared with \\nother forms of non-pharmacological perineal pain \\nrelief. The evidence and judgements related to the \\neffects of interventions (desirable effects, undesirable \\neffects, and certainty of the evidence) are presented \\nseparately for each of the comparisons by type \\nof control group. The remaining domains (values, \\nresources, equity, acceptability and feasibility) \\nwere considered to be similar across the different \\ncomparisons and by type of control group (no \\nintervention or usual care, other non-pharmacological \\nperineal pain relief techniques).'),\n",

Evidence and recommendations \\n23\\nA.2.2 Or al analgesia for perineal pain relief\\nRECOMMENDATION 5\\nOral paracetamol is recommended as first-line choice when oral analgesia is required for the relief of \\npostpartum perineal pain. (Recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• In making this recommendation, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) agreed perineal pain relief \\nshould be individualized, considering the presence of perineal trauma, intensity of the pain, multiple \\nsources of postpartum pain (e.g. perineal, uterine, breast pain), the use of the lowest effective dose for \\nthe shortest period of time, and adverse effects and contraindications, including breastfeeding. The use \\nof single-dose paracetamol given to the woman in the immediate postnatal period is unlikely to pose any \\nsignificant risk to the newborn as the amount likely to be excreted in breastmilk would be very little and \\nthe volume of breastmilk consumed by the infant in the first days after birth is likely to be small. \\n• Aspirin is contraindicated during breastfeeding based on evidence of potentially harmful effects on \\nbreastfeeding babies due to salicylate and salicylate metabolites excreted in breastmilk.\\n• All women should be advised about the use of local cooling as a non-pharmacological option to relieve \\nacute pain from perineal trauma sustained during childbirth, based on availability and a woman’s \\npreferences (see Recommendation 4 in this guideline).\\n• In acknowledgement of the limited evidence on the comparative effectiveness of different oral analgesics, \\nthe GDG suggested that when local perineal cooling or paracetamol is not effective in relieving perineal \\npain, women should be advised of other pharmacological pain relief options based on safety profile (e.g. \\nallergies, adverse effects, contraindications), availability, experience with a particular analgesic and cost. \\n• All women should be asked about perineal pain and other perineal conditions (e.g. perineal trauma \\nhealing and haemorrhoids) during their postpartum stay in health facilities and at each postnatal care \\ncontact. Women should be advised on danger signs and symptoms, including any exacerbation of \\nperineal pain as a manifestation of postpartum complications such as haematomas, haemorrhoids and \\ninfection.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of the interventions (EB T able A.2.2) \\nEvidence was derived from three Cochrane reviews \\naddressing the effect of a single dose of paracetamol/\\nacetaminophen (51), acetylsalicylic acid (hereafter \\naspirin) (52) and of NSAIDs (53) compared \\nwith placebo or no intervention, or with another \\npharmacological agent, to reduce acute perineal pain \\nin the early postnatal period. The effect of different \\ndoses of the same drugs were also assessed. \\nParacetamol\\nEvidence was derived from 10 trials with 1367 women \\n(51). Five trials were published in the 1970s, four in \\nthe 1980s and the most recent in 1992. T rials were \\nconducted in Canada (1), France (1), the United \\nStates of America (USA) (7) and the Bolivarian \\nRepublic of Venezuela (1). No trials evaluated perineal \\npain relief after vaginal birth with intact perineum, \\nand no distinctions were made between episiotomy \\nand spontaneous lacerations. All trials were multi-\\narm including comparisons of paracetamol with other \\nanalgesics alone, or in combination, or with placebo. \\nAuthors of the review extracted only data from the \\nparacetamol versus placebo arms. T wo different \\ndoses of paracetamol were included in the trials: \\n500–650\\xa0mg and 1000\\xa0mg, versus placebo. \\nAspirin\\nEvidence was derived from 17 trials with 1132 \\nwomen (52).\\n29 T rials were conducted in Belgium (1), \\nCanada (1), India (1), the USA (11) and the Bolivarian \\nRepublic of Venezuela (3) between 1967 and 1997. \\nNo trials evaluated perineal pain relief after vaginal \\nbirth with intact perineum, and trials only included \\nwomen with episiotomy. Most trials clearly specified \\nthat breastfeeding was an exclusion criterion, and all \\nexcluded women with known sensitivity or allergy \\nto aspirin, and women who had previously received \\nanalgesia. Fifteen trials had multiple arms (between \\nthree and five) and, in addition to aspirin, assessed \\n29 One trial did not r eport the number of women recruited.'),\n",

(Recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• In making this recommendation, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) agreed uterine pain relief \\nshould be individualized, considering the intensity of the pain, multiple sources of postpartum pain (e.g. \\nperineal, uterine, breast pain), the use of the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time, and \\nadverse effects and contraindications, including breastfeeding.\\n• Aspirin is contraindicated during breastfeeding based on evidence of potentially harmful effects on \\nbreastfeeding babies due to salicylate and salicylate metabolites excreted in breastmilk.\\n• In acknowledgement of the limited evidence on the comparative effectiveness of different \\npharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for postpartum uterine pain relief, the GDG \\nsuggested that women should be advised of different options based on safety profile (e.g. allergy, adverse \\neffects, contraindications), availability, experience with a particular analgesic and cost. \\n• The GDG noted that use of opioids for the relief of pain due to uterine cramping should be discouraged \\nas opioids showed no advantage over NSAIDs, are associated with maternal adverse effects, are \\ncontraindicated during breastfeeding and are associated with a risk of developing psychological and \\nphysical dependence.\\n• All women should be informed about uterine involution and changes in lochia postpartum. They should \\nbe asked about abdominal pain and vaginal discharge during their postpartum stay in health facilities and \\nat each postnatal care contact. Women should be advised of danger signs and symptoms, including any \\nexacerbation of uterine pain as a manifestation of postpartum complications such as endometritis.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations: \\nPharmacological interventions compared \\nwith placebo \\nEffects of the interventions (EB T able A.2.3a) \\nEvidence was derived from an updated Cochrane \\nsystematic review on the relief of pain due to uterine \\ncramping/involution after vaginal birth (46). The \\nreview included 28 trials involving 2749 women, of \\nwhich 25 trials (2600 women) provided data for \\nanalyses. T welve trials had two comparison arms. \\nThe rest were multi-arm trials (from three to seven \\ngroups). All trials were small, with the number of \\nwomen allocated to the individual comparison arms \\nranging from 7 to 63. T rials were conducted in the \\nIslamic Republic of Iran (8), Norway (2), the USA \\n(13) and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (2). \\nMost trials were published prior to the year 2000. All \\nincluded trials compared any type of analgesia with \\nanother type of analgesia, placebo or no treatment. \\nPharmacological agents were compared with placebo \\nin 17 trials (1800 women), of which 15 trials (1411 \\nwomen) contributed data. \\nComparison 1: Paracetamol (oral, single-dose) \\ncompared with placebo\\nMaternal outcomes\\nRelief of symptoms: It is uncertain whether \\nparacetamol (650\\xa0mg) provides adequate pain relief \\nfor uterine cramping/involution when compared with \\nplacebo (very low-certainty evidence). \\nHealth service use: It is uncertain whether paracetamol \\n(1000\\xa0mg) affects the need for additional pain relief \\nfor uterine cramping/involution when compared with \\nplacebo (very low-certainty evidence).\\nAdverse effects: It is uncertain whether paracetamol \\nhas any effect on adverse effects when compared \\nwith placebo (very low-certainty evidence).

(Not recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• In this context, PFMT refers to the performance of repeated voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor \\nmuscles, according to a protocol that outlines the frequency (one or more sets of exercises per day), \\nintensity and progression of exercises, as well as the duration of the training period (e.g. at least several \\ndays of the week, for at least eight weeks) and may include maintenance pelvic floor muscle exercises \\nafter initial training. \\n• While PFMT started after childbirth is not recommended as a preventive measure, women with \\ninvoluntary loss of small volumes of urine (urinary stress incontinence) after childbirth should be advised \\nof the potential benefits of PFMT for treatment of urinary incontinence. For these women, in the absence \\nof stronger evidence, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) agreed that unsupervised pelvic floor \\nexercises performed at home may be beneficial and are unlikely to cause harmful effects. Pelvic floor \\nmuscle exercises may also positively affect sexual function in the postnatal period and promote self-care.\\n• All women should be informed during pregnancy and postnatally about potential pelvic floor problems, \\nincluding urinary or faecal incontinence after childbirth.\\n• The GDG recognized that the effects of PFMT started in early pregnancy for pregnant women who do not \\nhave incontinence were not evaluated during the guideline process.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of the interventions (EB T able A.2.4) \\nEvidence was derived from an updated Cochrane \\nsystematic review of PFMT for preventing and \\ntreating urinary and faecal incontinence in antenatal \\nand postnatal women (48). For the purpose of this \\nguideline, only evidence from the trials evaluating \\nPFMT initiated in the postpartum period were \\nincluded. The data were derived from 19 RCT s \\nwith 5452 women, conducted largely in HICs. One \\nmulticentre trial was conducted across New Zealand \\nand the United Kingdom. \\nFourteen trials (4293 women) reported postnatal \\nPFMT for mixed prevention and treatment of \\nincontinence. For women who were continent at \\nenrolment, PFMT was intended as a preventive \\ntreatment, while for women who had symptoms of \\nincontinence at enrolment, PFMT was intended as a \\ntherapeutic treatment. Women were randomized to \\npostnatal PFMT versus usual care versus no PFMT. \\nFrom these, nine trials (3651 women) reported on the \\noutcomes of interest. Due to the mixed population of \\nwomen recruited in these trials, the relative effects \\nof PFMT as a preventive treatment versus PFMT as a \\ntherapeutic treatment could not be disentangled.\\nFive trials (1159 women) included postpartum women \\nwho reported leakage of urine, faeces or both. One \\ntrial recruited women within six weeks post-birth, \\none between 10 and 16 weeks, and three trials \\nrecruited women at or beyond three months post-\\nbirth. Women were randomly allocated to supervised \\nPFMT (as a treatment for incontinence) or to controls \\n(women not receiving PFMT or receiving usual \\ncare). Only four trials (1061 women) reported on the \\noutcomes of interest.\\nComparison 1: Postnatal PFMT compared with no \\nintervention or usual care for (mixed) prevention or \\ntreatment of incontinence\\nRelief of symptoms: Low-certainty evidence suggests \\nPFMT may improve urinary incontinence in the early \\npostnatal period (0–3 months) when compared \\nwith no PFMT (2 trials, 321 women; RR\\xa00.54, 95% \\nCI\\xa00.44 to 0.66). It is uncertain whether PFMT \\naffects urinary incontinence in the mid-postnatal \\nperiod (> 3–6 months) when compared with usual \\ncare (very low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty \\nevidence suggests PFMT may have little or no effect \\non urinary incontinence in the late postnatal period \\n(> 6–12 months) when compared with no PFMT \\nor usual care (3 trials, 826 women; RR\\xa00.88, 95%'),\n",

Likewise, \\nhealth workers may be reluctant to raise the issue \\nwith women as part of routine care (61).

(Recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• In making this recommendation, the Guideline Development Group acknowledged that the evidence was \\ninsufficient to conclude on the added value of cabbage-leaf cream, cold cabbage leaves, cold gel packs, \\nwarm herbal compress and breast massage over usual breastfeeding counselling and support for the \\ntreatment of breast engorgement during breastfeeding, which were often incorporated into the control \\narms of the trials evaluated. \\n• Some women may find that the non-pharmacological interventions evaluated relieve breast pain and \\nhardness and may choose to use these methods. Women should be informed that it is unclear whether \\nthese treatment options for breast engorgement have adverse effects, due to a paucity of data.\\n• In this context, responsive breastfeeding (63, 64) refers to the mother responding to her baby’s cues, as \\nwell as her own desire to breastfeed. Responsive feeding is distinct from demand feeding, as it recognizes \\nthe reciprocal mother–baby relationship and benefits of breastfeeding beyond the alleviation of hunger.\\n• All women should be advised of common breast conditions associated with lactation, such as sore or \\ncracked nipples, engorgement and mastitis, and encouraged to report any signs and symptoms to their \\ncare providers.\\nT able 3.20 Summary of judgements: Postnatal \\nPFMT compared with usual care or no intervention\\nDomain Judgement\\nDesirable effects Don’t know\\nUndesirable effects Don’t know\\nCertainty of the evidence Very low\\nValues Probably no important \\nuncertainty or variability\\nBalance of effects Don’t know\\nResources required Varies\\nCertainty of the evidence \\non required resources\\nNo included studies\\nCost-effectiveness Don’t know\\nEquity Varies\\nAcceptability Probably yes\\nFeasibility Varies'),\n",

The \\nduration of the interventions varied from a single \\napplication to treatments given for up to three days. \\nAll trials reported that women in both groups received \\ninformation and advice on breastfeeding. Follow-\\nup varied from 15 minutes to six months after the \\nintervention. Most trials followed women for two to \\nseven days, or until improvement of symptoms. \\nThe review authors were unable to pool the results \\nfrom the trials in a meta-analysis because of \\nheterogeneity of interventions, assessment and \\nreporting of outcomes.\\nComparison 1: Subcutaneous oxytocin compared \\nwith placebo\\nOne trial (45 women) compared daily oxytocin 2.5\\xa0IU \\ngiven subcutaneously until breasts became soft \\nversus placebo.\\nMaternal outcomes\\nRelief of symptoms: It is uncertain whether the \\nuse of subcutaneous oxytocin has any effect on \\nbreast engorgement at three days of treatment \\nwhen compared with placebo (very low-certainty \\nevidence). \\nAdverse effects were not reported in the included \\ntrial.

Approximately one in four women breastfeeding \\nduring the first 26 weeks postpartum experience \\nmastitis (72). Non-infective mastitis may result \\nfrom milk stasis, blocked ducts, engorgement, or \\nnipple or breast tissue damage often associated with \\npoor positioning and attachment of the infant at \\nthe breast and incomplete emptying of the breasts \\n(50). Infective mastitis may result from cracked \\nor traumatized nipples and may lead to abscess \\nformation (50). Prevention of mastitis usually \\ninvolves effective removal of milk, ensuring good \\ninfant positioning and attachment, massaging the \\nbreast during feeding, as well as supportive measures \\nsuch as rest, adequate fluids, the application of warm \\ncompresses and oral analgesia.\\nPostpartum constipation\\nConstipation refers to infrequent, hard, dry or \\nbulky stools that are difficult or painful to pass, a \\nfeeling of incomplete evacuation or obstruction, or \\nthe need for manual manoeuvres to complete the \\nevacuation (73). The prevalence of self-reported \\npostpartum constipation is 15–62% (74). Causes of \\npostpartum constipation include hormonal changes \\nduring pregnancy and the puerperium, pelvic floor \\ndisorders (including perineal pain after childbirth \\nand perineal trauma), fear of perineal wound \\nbreakdown, haemorrhoids, and adverse effects \\nof iron supplementation or drugs received during \\npregnancy and childbirth (e.g. analgesics, opiates, \\nmagnesium sulphate or enemas) (74). Disrupted \\neating during active labour and in the immediate days \\npostpartum may negatively affect bowel movements. \\nIn the later postpartum period, cultural practices \\nand diet restrictions, disrupted food and water \\nconsumption, and emotional concerns may also affect \\nbowel movements (74). Strategies for preventing \\nconstipation include pharmacological interventions \\n(e.g. laxatives) and non-pharmacological interventions \\n(e.g. dietary and lifestyle modification and advice on \\npositioning during bowel movements) (74).\\nIn addition to the GDG recommendation on the \\nabove, this section of the guideline includes four \\nsets of recommendations on preventive measures \\nthat have been integrated from WHO guidelines on \\npreventing maternal infections that are relevant to \\nroutine postnatal care.\\nBox 3.4 Values\\nFindings from a qualitative evidence synthesis \\nexploring what women want from postnatal \\ncare (21) indicate that women want a positive \\nexperience in which they are able to adapt to \\ntheir new self-identity and develop a sense of \\nconfidence and competence as a mother. They also \\nwant to adjust to changes in their intimate and \\nfamily relationships (including their relationship \\nto their baby), navigate ordinary physical and \\nemotional challenges, and experience the dynamic \\nachievement of personal growth as they adjust \\nto their new normal, both as parents and as \\nindividuals in their own cultural context.'),\n",

Evidence and recommendations \\n63\\nA.3.1 Non-pharmac ological interventions to prevent postpartum mastitis \\nRECOMMENDATION 10\\nFor the prevention of mastitis in the postpartum period, women should be counselled and supported \\nto practise responsive breastfeeding, good positioning and attachment of the baby to the breast, hand \\nexpression of breastmilk, and the use of warm or cold compresses, based on a woman’s preferences. \\n(Recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• In making this recommendation, the Guideline Development Group acknowledged that the evidence was \\ninsufficient to conclude on the added value of probiotics, anti-secretory factor-inducing foods, acupoint \\nmassage, and specialist breastfeeding education over usual breastfeeding advice and support for the \\nprevention of mastitis during breastfeeding, interventions that were often incorporated into the control \\narms of the trials evaluated. \\n• In this context, responsive breastfeeding (63, 64) refers to the mother responding to her baby’s cues, as \\nwell as her own desire to breastfeed. Responsive feeding is distinct from demand feeding, as it recognizes \\nthe reciprocal mother–baby relationship and benefits of breastfeeding beyond alleviation of hunger.\\n• All women should be advised of common breast conditions associated with lactation, such as sore or \\ncracked nipples, engorgement and mastitis, and encouraged to report any signs and symptoms to their \\ncare providers.\\n• Providers should support women to continue breastfeeding with breast engorgement if they wish to, \\nas per the 2017 WHO guideline Protecting, promoting and supporting breastfeeding in facilities providing \\nmaternity and newborn services (75). \\n• All women should receive breastfeeding counselling in accordance with the 2018 WHO guideline \\nCounselling of women to improve breastfeeding practices (76).\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of the interventions (EB T able A.3.1) \\nEvidence was derived from an updated Cochrane \\nsystematic review on interventions for preventing \\nmastitis after childbirth (50), which includes \\n10\\xa0trials with 3034 women. This review included \\nboth pharmacological and non-pharmacological \\ninterventions, which are each addressed separately \\nfor the purposes of this guideline. The current \\nsummary includes six trials (2215 women) evaluating \\nnon-pharmacological interventions, which were \\nconducted in Australia (1 trial), Brazil (1), China (2), \\nSpain (1) and Sweden (1), and published between \\n2004 and 2018. \\nT wo trials (of which only one provided data) \\ncompared probiotics with placebo. The other three \\ntrials evaluated hydrothermally processed cereals, in-\\nhospital specialist breastfeeding education and breast \\nacupoint massage. \\nAll the trials included women who did not have \\nmastitis at enrolment.\\nComparison 1: Probiotics compared with placebo\\nProbiotics were given daily in the form of capsules \\ncontaining Lactobacillus fermentum 3 in one trial \\n(625 women). Results of the largest trial conducted \\nin Australia (639 women) are unavailable due to \\na contractual agreement between the probiotics \\nsupplier and the trialists.\\nMaternal outcomes\\nPrevention of symptoms: It is uncertain whether \\nprobiotics reduce the number of women with nipple \\ndamage within six months postpartum, or breast pain \\n(very low-certainty evidence). \\nShort-term maternal morbidity: Low-certainty evidence \\nsuggests probiotics may make little or no difference \\nto the risk of mastitis when compared with placebo \\n(1\\xa0trial, 291 women; RR\\xa00.58, 95% CI\\xa00.33 to 1.02). \\nMaternal functioning/well-being and adverse effects \\nwere not reported in the included trials. Health service \\nuse and experience of postnatal care was not reported \\nin the systematic review.'),\n",

(Recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• Dietary advice and information to prevent constipation during the postnatal period should include \\npromoting a healthy balanced diet with adequate intake of water and dietary fibre (found in vegetables, \\nfruit, nuts and whole grains) (78). Information should include factors related to constipation, as well \\nas advice on toileting habits (e.g. responding to the urge to have a bowel movement, and complete \\nevacuation) and engaging in low impact, physical activity (e.g. walking) for at least 150 minutes \\nthroughout the week (see Recommendation 22 in this guideline). Advice and information should \\nbe culturally sensitive, and tailored to a woman’s needs (e.g. considering mode of birth or birth \\ncomplications) and to specific contexts.\\n• Constipation during the postpartum period could potentially result from a range of antepartum, \\nintrapartum and postpartum-related events and circumstances, including haematinics used in pregnancy \\nand postpartum, disrupted drinking and eating during active labour, enemas, narcotic drugs administered \\nduring labour or post caesarean birth, and perineal pain related to trauma, haemorrhoids, irregular and \\naltered dietary patterns in the postnatal period, and psychosocial and situational factors. Prevention of \\nconstipation should include measures to address these common underlying factors. \\n• The Guideline Development Group (GDG) recognized the need to ensure that health workers adhere \\nto existing WHO recommendations as part of the strategies to prevent postpartum constipation (2014 \\nWHO recommendations for augmentation of labour [79] and 2018 WHO recommendations on intrapartum \\ncare for a positive childbirth experience [17]). \\n – For women at low risk, WHO recommends oral fluid and food intake and the adoption of mobility \\nduring labour.\\n – Administration of an enema for reducing the use of labour augmentation is not recommended.\\n• All women should be asked about their bowel movements during their postpartum stay in health facilities, \\nand at each postnatal care contact.\\n• In making this recommendation, the GDG took into account a stepwise approach for the prevention and \\ntreatment of constipation in the adult population, where the use of laxatives is applied only if dietary \\nmodifications or fibre supplementation fail to relieve the constipation, particularly given concerns about \\nmaternal and neonatal adverse effects of laxatives. The GDG suggested that this approach be applied in \\nthe immediate postpartum to stimulate first maternal bowel movements after childbirth and through the \\nentire postnatal period, after both vaginal and caesarean birth.\\n• Women with a history of constipation before or during pregnancy may benefit from continuing with \\ntreatments to relieve postpartum constipation.'),\n",

This \\nrecommendation does not apply to chronic constipation and acute constipation associated with other \\norgan dysfunctions (i.e. acute gastrointestinal dysfunction).\\n• In making this recommendation, the GDG considered a stepwise approach for the prevention and \\ntreatment of constipation in the adult population, where the use of laxatives is only applied if dietary \\nmodifications or fibre supplementation fail to relieve the constipation. The GDG suggested that this \\napproach be applied in the immediate postpartum to stimulate first maternal bowel movements after \\nchildbirth and through the entire postnatal period, after both vaginal and caesarean birth.\\n• All women should be asked about their bowel movements during their postpartum stay in health \\nfacilities, and at each postnatal care contact, and should receive dietary advice and information on factors \\nassociated with constipation as per Recommendation 12 in this guideline.\\n• The GDG agreed that further investigation on the effects of routine use of laxatives for preventing \\nconstipation in postpartum women is not a research priority.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of the interventions (EB T able A.3.3) \\nEvidence was derived from an updated Cochrane \\nsystematic review of interventions for preventing \\npostpartum constipation (74). Data for this evidence \\nsummary were derived from four trials involving 1061 \\nwomen, of which two were RCT s and two were quasi-\\nRCT s. T rial were conducted in Ireland (1), South Africa \\n(1) and the USA (2). All four trials were published \\n40 or more years ago. A fifth trial comparing laxative \\nplus a bulking agent versus laxative alone in women \\nwho had undergone surgical repair following anal \\nsphincter injuries during vaginal birth was not \\nconsidered in this evidence summary.\\nAll trials compared use of laxatives versus no \\nintervention or placebo. The laxatives evaluated \\nwere bisoxatin acetate, active senna, dorbanex, \\nand dioctyl-sodium succinate plus senna. bisoxatin \\nacetate is now contraindicated for breastfeeding \\nwomen, while dorbanex is no longer available as it \\nis “reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogen” \\nbased on animal studies (74). Therefore, only \\ndata from the trials including available treatments \\nand treatments indicated in postpartum women \\nare described below (two trials). In both of the \\nincluded trials, laxative treatment was commenced \\nimmediately after birth. \\nComparison: Laxatives compared with placebo\\nT wo eligible trials (755 women) examined the \\neffectiveness and safety of a laxative versus placebo. \\nThese trials were published in 1960 and 1980, and \\ncompared active senna or dioctyl-sodium succinate \\nplus active senna versus placebo.\\nMaternal outcomes\\nSymptoms of constipation – time to first bowel \\nmovements (days): Low-certainty evidence suggests \\nlaxatives may result in more women having their first \\nbowel movement less than 24 hours after birth when \\ncompared with placebo (1 trial, 471 women; RR\\xa02.90, \\n95% CI\\xa02.24 to 3.75). It is uncertain whether laxatives \\naffect the number of women having their first bowel \\nmovement on day 1 after birth (very low-certainty \\nevidence).

Evidence and recommendations \\n83\\nA.4 MENT AL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS\\nBackground\\nThe GDG considered the evidence and other \\nrelevant information to inform recommendations \\non the screening and prevention of common mental \\ndisorders in the postpartum period (depression and \\nanxiety). \\nDepression and anxiety during the postpartum period \\nare leading causes of disability in women around the \\nworld. Their prevalence is estimated at 13% in HICs \\nand 19.8% in LMICs (85). Despite a high burden of \\nillness, less than 20% of affected women report their \\nsymptoms to health workers, probably due to stigma \\nand poor help-seeking practices inherently associated \\nwith these disorders (86). In addition, depression \\nand anxiety have a profound impact on the parent-\\ninfant relationship, which is the foundation of the \\nfuture emotional, relational and social development \\nof the child. Different tools, such as the Edinburgh \\nPostnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Patient \\nHealth Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), have been used to \\nscreen for postpartum depression in routine primary \\nhealth care or for population-based screening at \\nthe community level. Post-screening management \\nmay involve various treatments and interventions \\ndepending on the specific context.\\nBox 3.5 Values\\nFindings from a systematic qualitative review \\nexploring what women want from postnatal care\\xa0(21) \\nindicate that some women experience periods \\nof low mood, depression and loneliness during \\nthe postnatal period (moderate confidence in the \\nevidence) and struggle with extended periods of \\ntiredness or exhaustion during the transition to \\nmotherhood (moderate confidence in the evidence). \\nFor first-time mothers in particular, these feelings \\nmay be exacerbated by anxieties and insecurities \\nabout their new role and their ability to adapt to \\nan idealized perception of a so-called good mother \\n(moderate confidence in the evidence). T o cope with \\nthese challenges, women appreciate the support \\nthey receive from family members, peers and health \\nworkers (high confidence in the evidence) and are \\ntherefore likely to value interventions that help them \\nto overcome any mental health concerns. Findings \\nfrom the same review also indicate that women \\nwant a positive experience in which they are able to \\nadapt to their new self-identity and develop a sense \\nof confidence and competence as a mother. They \\nalso want to adjust to changes in their intimate and \\nfamily relationships (including their relationship to \\ntheir baby), navigate ordinary physical and emotional \\nchallenges, and experience the dynamic achievement \\nof personal growth as they adjust to their new \\nnormal, both as parents and as individuals in their \\nown cultural context.'),\n",

For some \\nwomen there was a perception that mental health \\nscreening might be viewed as a test for so called \\nnormality, leading to subsequent concerns about \\nfeeling stigmatized. Other women felt that screening \\ncould be intrusive and insensitive and highlighted the \\nimportance of kind, well trained staff in the screening \\nprocess. \\nFeasibility\\nA qualitative evidence synthesis of women’s \\nexperiences of postnatal care (28) found no direct \\nevidence relating to feasibility of screening for \\ncommon maternal mental disorders. However, \\nindirect evidence indicates that some women value \\nthe time they spend with health workers and do not \\nlike to feel hurried through postnatal assessments \\nwithout having the opportunity to discuss assessment \\nrelated concerns (low confidence in the evidence). \\nThe availability of adequately staffed health facilities \\nwith sensitive, well-trained personnel is an important \\nconsideration for women (moderate confidence in the \\nevidence). \\nBuist et al. (93), in their evaluation of screening \\nprogrammes for postpartum depression in Australia, \\nprovided health workers’ perceptions on use of EPDS. \\nThe majority of nurses (83%), midwives (76%) and \\ngeneral practitioners (71%) reported that EPDS was \\neasy to use. \\nA qualitative evidence synthesis of health workers’ \\nviews and experience on the provision of postnatal \\ncare (29) suggests that lack of personnel and \\nresources may limit the offer of postnatal screening \\nfor common mental disorders in the postpartum \\nperiod (moderate confidence in the evidence). \\nHealth workers reported limited knowledge, training \\nand experience in screening women to identify \\npostpartum mental health issues (moderate \\nconfidence in the evidence), including the provision \\nof culturally sensitive care and support for women \\n(low confidence in the evidence), and knowledge \\nabout referrals and available services for women with \\nmental health conditions.\\nAdditional considerations\\nScreening for postpartum depression can be \\nembedded in routine health-care information systems \\nor in population-based screening at community level \\nthrough household surveys. \\nAfter screening for common postpartum mental \\ndisorders, provision of diagnosis and treatment \\nshould be a priority for health systems.

The Guideline Development Group agreed that psychosocial interventions \\nto support maternal mental health are an important component of early childhood health and development \\n(see Recommendation 41 in this guideline). \\n• Women with clinically significant symptoms or risk factors should be offered psychological interventions (e.g. \\ncognitive behavioural therapy or interpersonal therapy).\\n• The provision of these interventions should be decided in a collaborative manner based on the woman’s \\npreference and the care provider’s ability to deliver the intervention in terms of training, expertise and \\nexperience.\\n• Women at risk for postpartum depression and/ or anxiety are women who either (i) have exhibited depressive \\nsymptoms but scored below the cut-off for depressive disorder on screening tests, (ii) had previous episodes \\nof depression, or (iii) have social risk factors such as low income, intimate partner violence or being an \\nadolescent.\\n37 P sychoeducation is an evidence-based intervention\\xa0with systematic, structured information sharing about symptoms of depression/\\nanxiety and their prevention and treatment. It may also integrate emotional and motivational aspects\\xa0of the conditions and teach problem-\\nsolving and communication skills, providing education and resources in an empathetic and supportive environment.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of the interventions (EB T able A.4.2) \\nEvidence was derived from a systematic review of \\npsychological and psychosocial interventions for \\nprevention of common postpartum mental disorders \\n(94). The data were derived from 44 studies \\n(23\\xa0542 women), with the earliest study published \\nin 1995. Most studies (38) were conducted in \\nHICs. These interventions were focused on either \\nuniversal populations (21) or targeted populations \\n(23), including women with social stressors, with \\nsub-threshold depressive symptoms at baseline, or \\nspecific populations such as adolescents.\\nThe majority of interventions were psychosocial \\nin nature (28); the rest (16) had a psychological \\ntheoretical underpinning. Psychosocial interventions \\nincluded psychoeducational strategies, home visits \\nby allied health professionals or lay health workers, \\nor social support interventions. Psychological \\ninterventions included cognitive behavioural \\ntherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, mindfulness, \\nmind–body interventions and mood monitoring. \\nInterventions were employed either by mental \\nhealth specialists or non-specialists in mental health \\nincluding health professionals trained in specific \\ntherapies (e.g. general practitioners, midwives, nurses \\nand allied health workers, peers and partners). All \\ninterventions were delivered face-to-face except \\none, which was delivered using an online medium. \\nHeterogeneous tools and psychometric scales were \\nused for assessment of depression and anxiety in the \\nincluded studies.\\nAll interventions, irrespective of their time point of \\ndelivery (antenatal period, postnatal period, or both), \\naimed to prevent either postpartum depression \\nor anxiety. Therefore, all outcomes reported in \\nthe systematic review were measured during the \\npostpartum period. This report provides separate \\nmeta-analyses for interventions according to the \\ntiming of intervention delivery.'),\n",

In \\naddition, women appreciate continuity (of care and \\ncarer) so any intervention that is delivered during \\nboth the antenatal and postnatal phases should, \\nideally, be provided by the same person (high \\nconfidence in the evidence). \\nFindings from a synthesis on the perspectives of \\nwomen, men and health workers on discharge \\npreparedness, derived from a scoping review on \\ndischarge preparation and discharge readiness \\n(91), indicate that care for women is often seen \\nto be overlooked during the postnatal care \\nperiod, with predominant emphasis put on the \\ncare of the baby (moderate confidence in the \\nevidence) and assumptions that women receive \\nthe information they need during antenatal care \\n(low confidence in the evidence). The discharge \\nprocess is often viewed as rushed by both women \\nand health workers, including provision of too much \\ninformation, women wanting to get home early, \\ntime limitations and health workforce shortage (low \\nconfidence in the evidence).

Ne wborn care\\nB.1 NEWBORN AS SESSMENT\\nBackground\\nEarly detection of conditions that may adversely \\naffect the health and development of the newborn \\nis an important component of quality routine \\npostnatal care. \\nFor guidance on routine assessment of the newborn, \\nhealth workers should refer to WHO’s operational \\nmanual (39), in which detailed guidance on \\nassessment of the newborn is provided.\\nIn this section of the guideline, the GDG considered \\nthe evidence and other relevant information to inform \\nrecommendations on universal screening for the \\nfollowing conditions.\\nAbnormalities of the eye\\nAn estimated 1.14 million children aged 0–15 years \\nare blind or severely visually impaired from eye \\nconditions (112). The major causes of blindness \\nin children are congenital and developmental \\ncatarsact, corneal scarring, congenital eye anomalies, \\nretinal dystrophies, glaucoma and retinopathy of \\nprematurity. Conditions which are present at birth \\ncan be detected by screening during the neonatal \\nperiod, and affected newborns can be referred for \\ntreatment, such as surgery for cataract, glaucoma and \\nretinoblastoma (a malignant tumour), longer term \\nfollow-up, or referral for a general health assessment \\nor vision rehabilitation (113). Newborn eye screening \\nis usually undertaken using a torch light to examine \\nthe external structures of the eye, and red reflex \\ntesting, which requires a direct ophthalmoscope or a \\nsuitable alternative. \\nHearing impairment\\nThe prevalence of severe to profound permanent \\nbilateral hearing loss (PBHL) in newborns is \\nreported to be 1–1.5 per 1000 newborns in HICs \\n(114, 115). PBHL is defined as bilateral permanent \\nconductive (bone, ear canal or ear drum problems) \\nor sensorineural (nerve or brain damage) hearing \\nloss of 35 dB or greater in the better ear (116). It \\noccurs during the intrauterine or congenital period \\n(due to infections such as TORCH [toxoplasmosis, \\nrubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, syphilis], \\ngenetic and craniofacial problems) and also during \\nthe postnatal period (e.g. due to intracranial insults, \\nmeningitis, jaundice, ototoxic antibiotics). T wo tests \\nthat can detect hearing loss in newborns and infants \\nunder 6 months of age are otoacoustic emissions \\n(OAE) and automated auditory brainstem response \\n(AABR), used alone or in combination.\\nHyperbilirubinaemia\\nNeonatal unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinaemia \\nis a common condition that affects approximately \\n60–80% of otherwise healthy newborns (117, 118). \\nIt manifests in the first days after birth as jaundice. \\nBiochemically, it is defined by an increase in total \\nserum bilirubin (TSB) as a result of an elevated \\nindirect serum bilirubin. Although most newborns \\npresent with physiological jaundice, which is \\nfrequently normal and benign, a subset of newborns \\nwill develop severe disease warranting treatment \\nand necessitating hospitalization in the first weeks \\nafter birth (117, 118). Severe jaundice, if not diagnosed \\nand treated in time, can lead to acute bilirubin \\nencephalopathy, bilirubin-induced neurological \\ndysfunction (BIND) or, in the most severe cases, \\nkernicterus and/ or jaundice-related death. Clinically, \\njaundice is recognized by visual inspection, and \\nthe serum bilirubin levels are estimated non-\\ninvasively through the skin using a transcutaneous \\nbilirubinometer (T cB) and/ or confirmed invasively \\nby blood sample and laboratory estimation of \\nTSB. Visual inspection (with or without risk factor \\nassessment) is a commonly used screening method, \\nespecially in resource-constrained settings. TSB is the \\nmost accurate method of serum bilirubin estimation, \\nbut it requires a heel prick and laboratory assessment. \\nIn addition to the GDG recommendations and \\nguidance on the above, this section of the guideline \\nincludes one recommendation on assessment of the \\nnewborn for danger signs that has been integrated \\nfrom the 2014 WHO recommendations on postnatal \\ncare of the mother and newborn (15).'),\n",

(Recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• In making this recommendation, regardless of gestation or risk factors, the Guideline Development Group \\nagreed that although evidence on the effects originated from high-income countries, the evidence on \\nresources, cost effectiveness, values, equity, acceptability and feasibility demonstrate that UNHS could be \\nsuccessfully implemented in low- and middle-income countries.\\n• PBHL is defined as bilateral permanent conductive or sensorineural hearing loss of 35 dB or greater in the \\nbetter ear. \\n• If UNHS indicates possible PBHL, a follow-up definitive test must be done as soon as possible after \\nscreening. This involves testing by an audiologist with a more detailed diagnostic auditory brainstem \\nresponse in a highly-controlled environment. It takes 30–60 minutes to complete the diagnostic test.\\n• The principles for screening programmes (87) must be implemented throughout UNHS introduction and \\nscale-up. In settings where principles for screening are not met, implementation of universal screening \\nmay be considered unethical. \\n• Parents and caregivers of all children should be informed about age-appropriate hearing and language \\ndevelopment and communication skills regardless of the screening results.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of the interventions (EB T able B.1.3) \\nEvidence was derived from a systematic review on \\nuniversal newborn hearing screening programmes \\nto detect children with PBHL (130). The review \\nincluded 30 non-randomized studies, of which \\nfive studies (1\\xa0023\\xa0610 newborns) that reported \\ncomparative effects of universal newborn hearing \\nscreening (UNHS) versus no UNHS were included \\nin this evidence summary. Studies were conducted \\nin Australia (1), the Netherlands (1), the United \\nKingdom (1) and the USA (2).\\nThe screening tests used in the intervention group \\nwere OAE, AABR, or both. Where described, \\nscreening was performed in the first 24–48 hours \\nafter birth or by 2 weeks of age. The comparison \\ngroup received either no screening at any time, no \\nscreening in the first eight months after birth followed \\nby distraction screening at eight months or later, \\nor risk factor screening. “Any hearing loss requiring \\namplification” was used to define PBHL in one study. \\nIn the other four studies, threshold levels in the better \\near of > 40 dB, > 35 dB or > 25 dB were used.\\nFour studies (1 171 737 newborns) were large \\npopulation-based studies of UNHS programmes. \\nThose failing the screening received a definitive \\nhearing assessment from an audiologist promptly \\nfollowing screening. Children with PBHL were \\nfollowed up to ascertain developmental outcomes. \\nThe remaining study (63 children) used a \\nretrospective cohort design, and reviewed medical \\nrecords of children with PBHL at 5 years of age to \\nascertain if they had received newborn screening, \\ndefinitive hearing testing, amplification devices \\n(hearing aids) and the timing of these procedures. \\nComparison: UNHS compared with no screening or \\nselective screening (no UNHS)\\nNewborn/infant outcomes\\nSevere neonatal/infant morbidity: Low-certainty \\nevidence suggests UNHS may make little or no \\ndifference to the proportion of infants identified with \\nPBHL when compared with no UNHS (3 studies, \\n1\\xa0023\\xa0497 newborns; RR\\xa01.01, 95% CI\\xa00.89 to 1.14). \\nLow-certainty evidence suggests UNHS may improve \\nthe proportion of infants identified with PBHL early \\n(before 9 months of age) when compared with no'),\n",

Evidence and recommendations \\n113\\nB.2 PREVENTIVE MEASURES\\nBackground\\nThe GDG considered the evidence and other relevant \\ninformation to inform recommendations on the \\nprevention of the following adverse outcomes during \\nthe neonatal period and/ or infancy.\\nHypothermia and its sequelae\\nNeonatal hypothermia is a common condition, \\naffecting between 32% and 85% of hospital-born \\nnewborns (159). The newborn’s first bath is intended \\nto eliminate blood and meconium from the skin, \\nleaving the vernix intact (160). However, bathing \\ncan be a stressful procedure for a newborn, and \\nearly bathing can trigger hypothermia and its related \\nconsequences, including hypoglycaemia, hypoxia and \\npulmonary haemorrhage (161). Bathing of neonates \\nis carried out using various methods including tub \\nbathing, sponge bathing, swaddled bathing and \\nbathing under running water. \\nAtopic dermatitis and other skin conditions\\nThe skin of a neonate is a dynamic and complex organ \\nthat is under the process of maturation. Neonates and \\ninfants have thin, highly permeable skin with a larger \\nbody surface area. T opical emollients may protect the \\nstratum corneum, increase its hydration, decrease \\nwater loss across the skin and can enhance epidermal \\nbarrier function (162). These emollients include \\ncreams, ointments, lotions, oils, gels, sprays and \\nemulsions, and are used for bathing, cleansing or as \\nleave-on emollients. While applying emollients prior \\nto the development of atopic dermatitis may help \\nin primary prevention of the condition, the plausible \\nharm is the potential destruction of the acid mantle, \\nwhich is key to epidermis function (163). Further, \\nabsorption of the excipients of emollients may result \\nin contact sensitivity and epidermal injury (163).\\nNeonatal infection \\nSevere neonatal infection is a leading cause of \\nglobal neonatal mortality (164). During the first days \\nafter birth, the healing umbilical cord stump is a \\npossible entry point for infection, including through \\ncolonization of the stump with potentially pathogenic \\nmicroorganisms (165). In LMICs, traditional \\npractices to seal the umbilical cord stump involve the \\napplication of potentially harmful substances to the \\narea (e.g. dirt, dust, clay, mud and animal dung) (166), \\nwhich further increase the risk of systematic infection \\nand tetanus. Chlorhexidine is a broad-spectrum \\nantiseptic that is applied topically to the umbilical \\ncord stump and base for the prevention of neonatal \\ninfection. \\nSudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) \\nSIDS is defined as “the sudden unexpected death \\nof an infant less than 1 year of age, with onset \\nof the fatal episode apparently occurring during \\nsleep, that remains unexplained after a thorough \\ninvestigation, including performance of a complete \\nautopsy and review of the circumstances of death \\nand the clinical history” (167). The umbrella terms \\n“sudden unexpected death in infancy” (SUDI) and \\n“sudden unexpected infant death” (SUID) refer to all \\nunexplained deaths in infancy, as well as deaths due \\nto known causes (e.g. suffocation, malformations, \\narrhythmias) (168). According to the triple risk model \\n(169), an infant is susceptible to SIDS where all of \\nthree independent factors are present: (i)\\xa0exogenous \\nstressors (e.g. prone position, overheating, infection, \\nhead covering); (ii) critical development period in \\nhomeostatic control; and (iii) infant vulnerability \\n(e.g. due to prematurity, low birthweight or nicotine \\nexposure). Prone (lying with chest down or back up) \\nsleeping position is considered one such exogenous \\nstressor, which may disrupt infant cardiovascular \\nfunctioning, increasing the risk of hypoxia, \\nbradycardia, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, gasping \\nand death (168). \\nBox 3.10 Values\\nFindings from a qualitative evidence synthesis \\nexploring what women want from postnatal \\ncare (21) indicate that women want a positive \\nexperience in which they are able to adapt to \\ntheir new self-identity and develop a sense of \\nconfidence and competence as a mother. They also \\nwant to adjust to changes in their intimate and \\nfamily relationships (including their relationship \\nto their baby), navigate ordinary physical and \\nemotional challenges, and experience the dynamic \\nachievement of personal growth as they adjust \\nto their new normal, both as parents and as \\nindividuals in their own cultural context. Findings \\nfrom the same review also indicate that women \\ntend to prioritize the needs of their baby and are \\nhighly likely to value any strategy that fosters infant \\ndevelopment and enhances breastfeeding and/ or \\ntheir baby’s general well-being (high confidence in \\nthe evidence).'),\n",

Evidence from \\nstudies conducted in high-risk populations, such as newborns with family history of allergic disease, \\npreterm and small for gestational age newborns were not considered.\\n• The recommendation does not preclude further research on emollient use in term, healthy newborns \\ngiven the lack of evidence on key neonatal outcomes.\\n• The studies included in the evidence base for this recommendation rarely reported harm.

Evidence and recommendations \\n129\\nB.3 NUTRITIONAL INTER VENTIONS\\nBackground\\nOptimal nutrition is crucial for newborns to \\nsurvive and thrive. The GDG considered the \\nevidence and other relevant information to inform \\nrecommendations relating to supplementation of two \\nimportant micronutrients, vitamin A and vitamin D. \\nVitamin A serves important functions in vision, the \\nimmune system and general cellular functioning \\n(196). Infants and young children have increased \\nvitamin A requirements due to their rapid growth \\nand development. However, infants are born with \\nlow vitamin A stores and are dependent on external \\nsources, most importantly breastmilk. In settings \\nwhere vitamin A deficiency and/ or undernutrition \\nis common, infants are likely to receive inadequate \\namounts of vitamin A from breastmilk due to poor \\nmaternal nutritional status (197). Globally, vitamin \\nA deficiency (serum retinol less than 0.70 μmol/L) \\nis estimated to affect about 33%, or 190 million, \\nchildren 6–59 months of age (198, 199). The highest \\nprevalence is found in South Asia (44%) and sub-\\nSaharan Africa (48%) (199). When severe, vitamin \\nA deficiency can cause visual impairment (night \\nblindness) and anaemia. It can also increase the risk \\nof illness and death from common and preventable \\nchildhood infections, such as measles and those \\ncausing diarrhoea. \\nVitamin D plays an important role in bone \\nmineralization, muscle contraction, nerve conduction, \\ngeneral cellular functioning and the immune system. \\nAcquisition of bone mineral content is greatest in \\nthe first year after birth (200), and adequate bone \\nmineralization during this period lays the foundation \\nfor strong bones later in life (201). Vitamin D has two \\nactive forms: vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin \\nD3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D2 is naturally present \\nonly in fungi, while vitamin D3 can be obtained from \\ndietary sources such as fatty fish and egg yolks, and/\\nor through synthesis in the body following exposure \\nto sunlight. Infants are generally considered to be at \\nhigh risk of vitamin D deficiency as they have limited \\nvitamin D stores at birth, infrequent exposure to \\nsunlight, and relatively large vitamin D requirements \\ndue to their rapid growth D (196). Severe vitamin D \\ndeficiency can lead to nutritional rickets; a skeletal \\ndisorder associated with impaired growth, limb and \\npelvic deformities, developmental delay, dental \\nabnormalities and hypocalcemic seizures (202). \\nAlthough exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for \\ninfants up to 6 months of age, low levels of vitamin D \\n(~50 IU/L) are often found in breastmilk (203).\\nBox 3.12 Values\\nFindings from a qualitative evidence synthesis \\nexploring what women want from postnatal \\ncare (21) indicate that women want a positive \\nexperience in which they are able to adapt to their \\nnew self-identity and develop a sense of confidence \\nand competence as a mother. Findings from the \\nsame review also indicate that women tend to \\nprioritize the needs of their infant (low confidence \\nin the evidence) and, with this in mind, appreciate \\npractical advice, support and information from \\nhealth workers (moderate confidence in the \\nevidence), provided this is delivered in a consistent \\nmanner and in a form they can understand \\n(moderate confidence in the evidence).'),\n",

(Context-specific recommendation)\\nRemarks\\n• The Guideline Development Group acknowledged that vitamin D supplementation is currently \\nrecommended within the first weeks after birth as part of national guidance in many countries to improve \\nvitamin D status and prevent rickets; however, there was agreement that, at the present time, there is \\ninsufficient evidence on the benefits and harms, if any, of routine vitamin D supplementation on health \\noutcomes of term, breastfed infants. \\n – Vitamin D supplementation in infants was found to improve 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) \\nconcentrations and reduce the prevalence of serum 25(OH)D concentrations <\\xa050\\xa0nmol/L.\\n – However, there was no evidence that vitamin D supplementation in infants reduces the prevalence of \\nserum 25(OH)D concentrations <\\xa030\\xa0nmol/L, prevents rickets or improves bone health. \\n – There was little evidence reported on adverse effects; however, adverse effects would not be expected \\nwith daily doses providing the safe and adequate intake level.\\n – Evidence from non-breastfed infants was not considered by this guideline panel as standards for infant \\nformula include fortification with vitamin D (213).\\n• In addition to variable acceptability of the intervention across stakeholders, the provision of vitamin D \\nsupplements in infants is likely to incur some costs, which does not support its use for all breastfed, term \\ninfants. \\n• It is generally recommended that infants less than 6 months of age be protected from UV rays as much as \\npossible, preferably being kept away from direct sunlight and having their skin protected by appropriate \\nclothing and hats to reduce the risk of skin cancer and adverse effects of excessive sunlight exposure \\n(e.g. sun burn). Phototherapy for the treatment of neonatal jaundice is an exception to this general \\nrecommendation.\\n• Research in this context includes adequately powered studies on the effect of neonatal vitamin D \\nsupplementation on mortality, morbidity, growth and development, including clinically relevant outcomes \\n(both benefits and harms), assessment of vitamin D status and cost-effectiveness of this intervention in \\nbreastfed and non-breastfed infants. \\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of the interventions (EB T able B.3.2) \\nEvidence was derived from an updated Cochrane \\nsystematic review of vitamin D supplementation \\nfor breastfed, term infants to prevent vitamin D \\ndeficiency and improve bone health (214). T rials \\nevaluating vitamin D supplementation given directly \\nto the infant were included in this evidence summary. \\nEight trials (536 breastfed infants) were considered, \\none of which was a three-arm trial. T rials were \\nconducted in Australia (1), India (1), Mexico (1), \\nNorway (1), Spain (1) and the USA (3). \\nAll infants were singleton, healthy, full-term \\ninfants, exclusively breastfed or whose mothers \\nintended to exclusively breastfeed. Initiation of \\nsupplementation varied across studies, from at \\nbirth to six weeks after birth (where described). \\nDoses and active forms of vitamin D also varied \\nacross trials: vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) drops \\nat a dose of 400 IU/ day until seven weeks, and \\nthree and six months were used in three trials \\n(88\\xa0infants); vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) drops at \\na single dose of 50\\xa0000 IU were used in one trial \\n(49 infants); and doses of 200 IU, 400 IU, 402 IU/\\nday until 6, 9 and 12 months were used in four trials \\n(448 infants). Subgroup analyses were performed \\nfor infants at high-risk of vitamin D deficiency, \\ndue to skin pigmentation, covering or avoidance of \\nsun exposure, and/ or latitude (that is, insufficient \\nultraviolet intensity most of the year) versus low-\\nrisk infants, vitamin D dose, time of initiation, and \\nform of vitamin D (D2 or D3).'),\n",

Effective interventions to improve newborn \\nnutrition in such populations could help to address \\nhealth inequities. However, if caregivers and families \\nare expected to pay for supplements, vitamin D \\nsupplementation may decrease equity.\\nAdditional considerations\\nIn the USA, daily vitamin D supplementation has \\nbeen recommended for breastfed infants since 2008 \\n(219). In an examination of trends in meeting vitamin \\nD intake among infants in the USA since 2009 (220), \\nonly 20.5% of breastfed infants were found to meet \\nthe intake requirements of 400 IU/ day of vitamin \\nD. Breastfed infants in families with a total income \\n≥\\xa0400% of the federal poverty level, with a head of \\nhousehold being a college graduate, and with private \\nhealth insurance, were more likely to meet the intake \\nguidelines. The authors suggested that renewed \\nconsiderations are needed for how best to meet \\nrecommended vitamin D intake for infants.\\nAcceptability\\nA qualitative evidence synthesis of women’s \\nexperiences of postnatal care found no direct \\nevidence relating to women’s views on vitamin D \\nsupplementation for breastfed, term infants (28). \\nIndirect evidence from this review indicates that \\nwomen want more information and support from \\nhealth workers, particularly around the feeding and \\nnutritional needs of their infant (high confidence in \\nthe evidence) and are likely to welcome interventions \\nthat optimize the well-being of their baby (moderate \\nconfidence in the evidence). However, women in \\ncertain contexts (particularly LMIC settings) may \\nbe resistant to vitamin supplementation because of \\npersonal preferences or community expectations \\nrelating to traditional dietary and/ or nutritional \\npractices (moderate confidence in the evidence).\\nAdditional considerations\\nA survey of breastfeeding mothers showed just over \\nhalf supplemented their young infants with vitamin \\nD in the preceding week, with 42% receiving the \\nrecommended dose of 400 IU (221). Most found \\nadministering vitamin D supplements easy, but 6% \\nfound it burdensome. The great majority (88%) of \\nmothers preferred to supplement themselves rather \\nthan their infants. Reasons for not supplementing \\ninfants with vitamin D included lack of knowledge \\nabout supplementation, belief that breastmilk \\nprovided infants with adequate vitamin D, \\ninconvenience, or their infant’s apparent dislike of the \\nsupplement (221). \\nAn observational study of a primary care practice \\nin the USA showed just over 36% of paediatricians \\nrecommended vitamin D supplementation for \\nbreastfed newborns (222). Those who did not \\nrecommend supplementation were more likely to \\nbelieve that the guidance to supplement was not \\nevidence-based. Only 44.6% of parents of infants \\nwhose paediatrician recommended supplements \\nactually provided them. About two thirds of parents \\nof infants predominantly breastfed for at least six \\nmonths believed breastmilk contained adequate \\namounts of nutrients for infants, and only 3% of their \\ninfants received vitamin D supplementation (222).\\nThere is some concern among health workers and \\nbreastfeeding advocates that recommendations to \\nsupplement breastmilk with vitamin D will imply to \\nwomen that formula is superior to breastmilk (223, \\n224).

Massage can \\nbe done using different techniques, with or without \\nthe application of oils, such as nut, mineral and \\nvegetable oils (228). Body massage serves to \\nimprove circulation and soothe the peripheral and \\ncentral nervous system (229). Massage has been \\nshown to increased vagal activity (230), which leads \\nto decreased cortisol and catecholamine levels \\n(231). This effect provides a rationale for the stress-\\nreducing properties of massage. Increased vagal \\nactivity also increases secretion of insulin and gastrin, \\nwhich promotes nutrient absorption, and increases \\nbowel movements and hence stool frequency, which \\nreduces bilirubin circulation. The tactile stimulation \\nprovided by the massage might contribute to a better \\nneonatal experience that could help with overall \\ndevelopment (229). Massage has been found to \\npromote soothing behaviour in infants and better \\nparent–infant interactions (232). \\nIn addition to the GDG recommendation on the \\nabove, this section of the guideline includes four \\nrecommendations on improving early childhood \\ndevelopment that have been integrated from existing \\nWHO guidelines relevant to routine postnatal care. \\nB.4.1 Whole-body mas sage \\nRECOMMENDATION 37\\nGentle whole-body massage may be considered for term, healthy newborns for its possible benefits to \\ngrowth and development. (Recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• In this context, gentle whole-body massage refers to using hands for tactile stimulation, with rubbing and \\nslow stroking of body parts or a passive range of motion across limb joints, with or without emollients.\\n• In making this recommendation, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) considered the effects of \\nwhole-body massage on length, weight and head circumference to be large, clinically meaningful and \\nof critical importance for the newborn. The GDG acknowledged that evidence was of low to very low \\ncertainty and the biological mechanisms for the large effects are unclear. \\n• There is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of the use of emollients for massage, type of provider, \\nfrequency and duration of sessions, length of intervention and techniques of massage. However, the GDG \\nagreed that the use of emollients might facilitate massage.\\n• In most of the trials evaluated, the whole-body massage was given for 10 to 20 minutes per day for six to \\neight weeks by the mother after initial training. \\n• Babies’ reactions to whole-body massage must be respected in line with the principles of responsive \\ncaregiving and respectful care. Massage should be used as an important opportunity to promote  \\nparent–infant interaction and stimulation for early childhood development.'),\n",

This section of the guideline \\ndescribes health systems and health promotion \\ninterventions to improve the provision, utilization \\nand experience of postnatal care. Specifically, the \\nGDG considered the evidence and other relevant \\ninformation to inform recommendations relating to \\nlength of stay and discharge from health facilities, \\nfrequency and place of postnatal care contacts, and \\ninvolvement of men in care.\\nSchedules and place of postnatal care \\ncontacts\\nRoutine postnatal care services provide a delivery \\nplatform for care of healthy women and their healthy \\nnewborns. It is provided at different time windows, \\noften by different health workers in different places \\n(6). Despite its importance, coverage and quality of \\npostnatal care for women and newborns tend to be \\nrelatively poor (12). Routine postnatal care is provided \\nin outpatient settings (office or health facilities) \\nor at home. Its purpose is to assess the health and \\nwell-being of the women and newborns, to provide \\nbreastfeeding and hygiene counselling, parenting \\nand child health counselling and general support \\nto families, and to facilitate access to timely care. \\nIn addition, home visits provide an opportunity to \\nassess the home environment. Different modalities of \\npostnatal home visits have been introduced, mainly to \\nensure early postnatal care contacts for women and \\nnewborns, either after discharge from health facilities \\n(242, 243), to replace or complement outpatient \\npostnatal care contacts, or as part of community-\\nbased packages, particularly in rural areas (244).\\nLength of stay in, and discharge from, health \\nfacilities\\nLength of stay in health facilities after childbirth \\nvaries widely between countries, from a few hours to \\nup to 6 days for singleton vaginal births, and from 2.5 \\nto 9 days following caesarean births (11). There has \\nbeen a steady decline in the length of time woman–\\ninfant dyads spend in health facilities after birth. \\nShorter postnatal stays have been promoted in some \\nsettings to decrease medicalization of the immediate \\npostnatal period and to increase maternal–infant \\nbonding and satisfaction. However, concerns have \\nbeen raised that early discharge from health facilities \\nmay delay identification and early management of \\nmaternal and newborn complications and lead to \\ninsufficient time to prepare women and families \\nfor the transition to the home, particularly if there \\nis insufficient or absent support in the community \\n(242). Observational studies have assessed the \\nrelationship between length of postnatal hospital \\nstay for healthy women and newborns and related \\noutcomes, showing conflicting results on neonatal \\nmortality, infant readmissions, and breastfeeding \\ninitiation and duration (242).\\nDecision-making around readiness for discharge is \\ncomplex and must consider not only the physical \\ncondition of the woman and newborn to identify \\nhealth risks, but also the woman’s birth experience, \\nthe woman and parents’ learning needs, and their \\nability to support the care of the mother and newborn \\n(245, 246). Discharge readiness is linked to the \\nquality of discharge preparation, which highlights the \\ncritical role that health workers play in the discharge \\npreparation process (247). \\nInvolvement of men in postnatal care and \\nmaternal and newborn health\\nInvolving men in supporting the care of their partners \\nand newborn children, throughout pregnancy, \\nchildbirth and after birth, is promoted as an effective \\nstrategy to improve maternal and newborn health \\noutcomes.

If birth is at home, the first postnatal contact should be as early as possible \\nwithin 24 hours of birth. At least three additional postnatal contacts are recommended for healthy \\nwomen and newborns, between 48 and 72 hours, between 7 and 14 days, and during week six after birth. \\n(Recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• The number, timing and content of postnatal care contacts should be tailored to each woman’s and \\nnewborn’s health outcomes and needs, and guided by the recommendations in this guideline, including:\\n – the woman’s and newborn’s physical well-being and the woman’s emotional well-being; \\n – the skills and confidence of the woman to care for herself and the skills and confidence of parents/\\ncaregivers/family to care for the newborn; \\n – the home environment and other factors that may influence the ability to provide care for the woman \\nand newborn in the home, and care-seeking behaviour; and\\n – the place of birth and the time of discharge from the health facility for a facility-based birth. \\n• In making this recommendation, the Guideline Development Group considered the following. \\n – There was insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials on the effects of more frequent \\npostnatal care contacts compared with less frequent contacts. \\n – Epidemiological data shows that most maternal and neonatal deaths occur in the first three days after \\nbirth, in particular on the day of birth, with another increase during the second week after birth.\\n – T ransition to well-woman and well-infant care will usually occur around week six after birth, including \\nreferrals to infant immunization and family planning services.\\n• Postnatal care contacts, in particular during the first week, can occur at home or in outpatient services \\n(e.g. the health facility or health worker’s office) by skilled health personnel or trained community health \\nworkers as per Recommendation 48 in this guideline, according to the preferences of women/ parents/\\ncaregivers and the organization of services as per the health system. \\n• Continuity of care is valued by women and health workers to establish supportive, caring and trusting \\nrelationships and improve experience of care. In settings with well-functioning midwifery programmes, \\nmidwife-led continuity-of-care models provide an opportunity to ensure continuity of postnatal care, as \\nper Recommendation 49 in this guideline.\\n• Routine postnatal care contacts may be complemented by phone-based follow-up or the use of digital \\ntargeted communication, as per Recommendation 54 in this guideline.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of the interventions (EB T able C.1) \\nEvidence was derived from an updated Cochrane \\nsystematic review assessing maternal and newborn \\noutcomes of different home visiting schedules \\nduring the early postpartum period (243).

Evidence and recommendations \\n157\\nC.2\\u2002Length of stay in health facilities after birth\\nRECOMMENDATION 45\\nCare for healthy women and newborns in the health facility is recommended for at least 24 hours after \\nvaginal birth. (Recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• Despite insufficient evidence, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) acknowledged that it was \\nimportant to establish a minimum time before discharge in light of the wide variation in length of stay \\nafter birth (11), including lengths of stay that were considered too short for the delivery of health facility \\ninterventions recommended in this guideline. \\n• The GDG acknowledged that timing of discharge from the health facility should be guided by the following.\\n – The time needed to complete the assessment of a comprehensive set of criteria to evaluate maternal \\nand newborn well-being and needs, and the findings of these assessments, as per Recommendation 46 \\nin this guideline. \\n – The health system’s capacity to organize postnatal care contacts after discharge through community-\\nbased services (e.g. home visits) or in outpatient services (e.g. in the health facility or provider’s \\noffice). Most healthy women and newborns would be ready for discharge 24 hours after birth, provided \\nfunctioning and accessible follow-up services are available.\\n – Unnecessarily prolonged stays in health facilities after birth should be avoided considering the \\nincreased risk of healthcare-associated infections, costs to the health system and to service users, and \\nwomen’s and families’ preferences.\\n• Given the paucity of evidence, the GDG was not able to recommend a minimum time of care in the health \\nfacility after caesarean birth, but noted that discharge within 24 hours after caesarean birth increased \\nthe risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes and reduced breastfeeding at six weeks. The content \\nof postnatal discharge criteria and discharge preparation would also need to consider post-operative \\noutcomes and the needs of women and newborns after a caesarean birth.\\n• As part of birth preparedness and complication readiness during pregnancy, women/ parents/ caregivers \\nshould be informed that stay in the heath facility after birth is recommended for a minimum of 24 hours. \\nHowever, length of stay in the health facility will depend on individual health outcomes and needs, \\nparticularly after a caesarean birth, and the availability of postnatal care services for follow-up after \\ndischarge.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of the interventions (EB T able C.2) \\nEvidence was derived from an updated Cochrane \\nsystematic review on policies of early postnatal \\ndischarge from hospital for healthy women and term \\ninfants (242), including 17 RCT s with 9409 women. \\nData on timing of discharge from 15 trials, reported \\nby mode of birth (vaginal or caesarean birth), are \\nincluded in this evidence summary. \\nThe timing of discharge and intensity of antenatal, \\nin-hospital (pre-discharge) and post-discharge \\ninterventions offered to the woman–infant dyads \\nin the intervention groups differed considerably \\nbetween trials. Standard discharge policies in the \\ncomparisons groups also varied greatly. \\nThe evidence and judgements are presented \\nseparately by mode of birth, based on a subgroup \\nanalysis from the Cochrane systematic review. \\nComparison 1: Early discharge following vaginal \\nbirth compared with usual discharge \\nT en studies (3553 women), published between 1962 \\nand 2005, included only women after vaginal births, \\nall conducted in HICs.

In \\nsome settings, perceived staff shortages and/ or the \\ndisruptive nature of postnatal wards (lack of privacy, \\nhospital visits, ward rounds) may lead to inadequate \\ncare and a perception among some women that they \\nare discharged too early from a health facility feeling \\nill-prepared and lacking in confidence about their \\nability to cope at home (moderate confidence in the \\nevidence). \\nFindings from a qualitative evidence synthesis on \\nthe perspectives of women, men and health workers \\nrelated to postnatal hospital discharge (91) indicate \\nthat women value postnatal education for themselves \\nand their partners and families to ensure parental \\nconfidence, and the opportunity to practice care \\nwith the support of a midwife (moderate confidence \\nin the evidence).

(Recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• In making this recommendation, the Guideline Development Group considered discharge criteria for \\nwomen and term newborns without complications described in policy and research documents as \\nidentified in a scoping review (91). \\n• These criteria should be assessed to guide health workers to identify and manage problems before \\ndischarge, to provide information as per the individual woman, newborn and family needs, and to \\nestablish links to follow-up care and additional support that may be required.\\n• Effective counselling and communication strategies, using culturally acceptable methods that respect and \\nfacilitate shared decision-making, are integral to the assessment of discharge criteria.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of the interventions \\nEvidence was derived from a scoping review on \\ndischarge preparation and readiness in facilities prior \\nto discharge after birth (91). The identified policy and \\nresearch documents in the scoping review did not \\nassess the effects of using criteria at discharge.\\nAdditional considerations\\nThe scoping review identified 13 policy documents \\nand 17 research documents with discharge criteria. \\nThe research documents included research studies \\n(9), review articles (3), commentaries (2), a thesis \\n(1), a medical news article (1), and an unpublished \\nevaluation report (1). From the 13 policy documents, \\n12 were postnatal specific documents and one was \\nconcerned with discharge of preterm infants. From \\nthe 17 research documents, 14 were concerned with \\npostnatal discharge, two were specific to discharge \\nof preterm infants and one focused on discharge of \\nhospitalized children. Policy documents originated \\nfrom Canada, India, the United Kingdom and the USA, \\nand five had a global focus. Research documents \\noriginated from Canada, Chile, France, Ireland, \\nPoland, Spain, T urkey, the United Kingdom, the USA \\nand the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \\nThree minimum discharge criteria were the most \\ncommonly referred to in the policy and research \\ndocuments: (i) assessment of maternal and infant \\nphysiological stability; (ii) knowledge, ability \\nand confidence regarding women’s self-care and \\nnewborn care; and (iii) availability to care for the \\nwoman and newborn following discharge. Most \\ndocuments mentioned assessment of maternal \\nand infant physiological stability as a criterion. In \\npolicy documents, the most commonly reported \\ncomponents were physical examination, nutrition \\nand weight status of the newborn. Research \\ndocuments mirrored this, with components for \\nassessing physical condition of the newborn \\nmentioned more often than assessment of maternal \\nhealth. Most documents reported assessment \\nof knowledge, ability and confidence regarding \\nself-care and infant care, including breastfeeding. \\nPolicy (8) and research (9) documents mentioned \\nassessment of availability of obstetric/ midwifery \\nand infant care following discharge.

Where home visits are \\nnot feasible or not preferred, outpatient postnatal care contacts are recommended. (Recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• In making this recommendation, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) considered evidence from \\ntrials where home visits for the provision of postnatal care were conducted mainly during the first week \\nafter birth.\\n• The content of postnatal care during home visits in the trials included assessments of the woman and \\nnewborn’s physical well-being and the woman’s emotional well-being with referral for further care where \\nnecessary, health education, counselling and breastfeeding promotion and support. \\n• The GDG noted that most trials showing a reduction in neonatal mortality were conducted in rural, \\nlow-resource settings with low access to health services and included community packages with home \\nvisits by trained community health workers, accompanied by antenatal home visits and community \\nmobilization. \\n• The capacity of the health system to provide postnatal care home visits should be assessed based on \\nlocal availability of skilled and trained health work force, distribution of tasks among the health workforce \\nand the competing responsibilities with other health programmes, capacity to provide initial and \\ncontinuous training and supervision, content of the postnatal care home visits, accessibility for hard to \\nreach populations, coordination between facility- and community-based services, and sustainability of the \\nhome visits programme and of the supply systems.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations: \\nHome visits for postnatal care contacts \\ncompared with usual care\\nEffects of the interventions (EB T able C.5a) \\nA systematic review (244) assessing effectiveness \\nand cost-effectiveness of home visits during the \\nearly postnatal period compared with no home \\nvisits, including nine RCT s with 93\\xa0083 newborns, \\ncontributed to the neonatal mortality outcome. \\nT rials were conducted n Bangladesh (2), Ghana (1), \\nIndia (3), Pakistan (2) and the Syrian Arab Republic \\n(1). T rained community health workers (CHWs) \\nimplemented the intervention in all studies except for \\ntwo, which trained a broader group of health workers \\n(CHWs, doctors, midwives or nurses). Most studies \\ncommenced home visits in the antenatal period. The \\nnumber of postnatal visits ranged from one to eight, \\nwith more than three visits in four trials. Postnatal \\nvisit timing ranged from day 1 to day 28 after birth. \\nA Cochrane systematic review (243) assessing \\nmaternal and neonatal outcomes of different home \\nvisiting schedules during the early postnatal period, \\nincluding 16 RCT s with 11\\xa0718 women, contributed to \\nthe other priority outcomes. This review excluded \\ntrials in which women were enrolled and received \\nan intervention during the antenatal period. T wo \\ntrials (969 women) were considered in this evidence \\nsummary, including one individually randomized \\nthree-arm trial (903 women), and one RCT (66 \\nwomen). The three-arm trial was conducted in the \\nSyrian Arab Republic, and included women of any \\nparity who had vaginal or caesarean birth (1103 \\nwomen). The other trial was conducted in T urkey and \\nincluded only primiparous women who had a vaginal \\nbirth. Women were discharged from hospital after \\n24 hours in the two trials. The number and content \\nof visits, and the cadres of health workers conducting \\nthe visits, varied. One trial compared one postnatal \\nvisit at three days after birth by a trained supporter \\nthat focused on breastfeeding education with no \\npostnatal home visits. The three-arm trial compared \\none home visit (on day 1 after birth) and four home \\nvisits (on days 1, 3, 7 and 30 after birth) from \\nregistered midwives, with no home visits or planned \\npostnatal care following hospital discharge.'),\n",

The \\nmidwifery philosophy inherent in MLCC models may or may not be enacted in standard midwifery \\npractice in other models of care. \\n – Policy-makers in settings without well-functioning midwifery programmes should consider \\nimplementing this model only after successfully scaling up the number and quality of practising \\nmidwives. In addition, stakeholders may wish to consider ways of providing continuous care through \\nother care providers, because women value continuity-of-care. \\n – The panel noted that, with this model of care, it is important to monitor resource use and health worker \\nburnout and workload, to determine whether caseload or team care models are more sustainable in \\nindividual settings. \\n – MLCC requires that well-trained midwives are available in sufficient numbers for each woman to see \\nonly one or a small group of midwives throughout pregnancy and during childbirth. This model may \\ntherefore require a shift in resources to ensure that the health system has access to a sufficient number \\nof midwives with reasonable caseloads. \\n – The introduction of MLCC may lead to a shift in the roles and responsibilities of midwives as well as \\nother health workers who have previously been responsible for antenatal and postnatal care. Where \\nthis is the case, implementation is likely to be more effective if all relevant stakeholders are consulted \\nand human resources departments are involved. In some settings, government-level consultation with \\nprofessional organizations could also aid implementation processes. \\n – The need for additional one-off or continuing training and education should be assessed, and should be \\nprovided where necessary.'),\n",

The GDG also recognized that digital notification of \\nbirths could facilitate providing newborns with a legal identity and future access to health and other \\nsocial services.\\n – It should also be noted that increases in the notification of births and deaths would require that \\ncivil registration services have, in turn, the capacity to manage a higher demand for registration and \\ncertification services. \\n – The ability for the health system and/ or CRVS system to respond and act appropriately on the birth \\nand death notification was seen as a critical component for successful implementation. If such linkages \\nare not in place, the notification of birth and death events would not add any value and would incur an \\nadditional cost for the system.'),\n",

Implementation of the WHO postnatal care recommendations \\n195\\n4. Implementation of the WHO \\npostnatal care recommendations\\nThis guideline aims to improve the quality of \\nessential, routine postnatal care for women and \\nnewborns with the ultimate goal of improving \\nmaternal and newborn health and well-being. These \\nrecommendations need to be delivered within an \\nappropriate model of postnatal care, adapted to \\nthe needs of different countries, local contexts, and \\nindividual women, newborns, parents, caregivers \\nand families. \\nWhile the members of the Guideline Development \\nGroup (GDG) proposed implementation \\nconsiderations for each recommendation (see Web \\nAnnex 5), they also reflected on considerations for \\nthe adoption, adaptation and implementation of \\nthe set of recommendations within this guideline to \\nensure availability, accessibility, acceptability and \\nquality of postnatal care services for all women and \\nnewborns, in accordance with a human rights-based \\napproach. Providers of postnatal health services \\nmust consider the needs of –\\xa0and provide\\xa0equal care \\nto – all individuals and their newborns.\\nThe WHO postnatal care model places the \\nwoman–newborn dyad at the centre of care (see \\nFig. 4.1). The foundation of this postnatal care \\nmodel is Recommendation 44, which supports \\na minimum of four postnatal care contacts. The \\nfirst contact refers to continued care in the health \\nfacility for at least the first 24 hours after birth or a \\nfirst postnatal contact within the first 24 hours for \\na home birth. At least three additional postnatal \\ncare contacts occur between 48 and 72 hours, \\nbetween 7 and 14 days, and during week six after \\nbirth. The overarching aim is to provide women, \\nnewborns, parents and caregivers with respectful, \\nindividualized, person-centred care at every contact. \\nThis includes the provision of effective clinical \\npractices (assessments, referrals and management), \\nrelevant and timely information, and psychosocial \\nand emotional support, by kind, competent and \\nmotivated health workers who are working within a \\nwell-functioning health system. An effective referral \\nsystem, including communication between facility- \\nand community-based care, and between health and \\ntransport systems in case of complications, are also \\nessential components of this postnatal care model. \\nWithin this model, the word “contact” implies an \\nactive interaction between women, newborns, \\nparents and caregivers, and care providers.\\nAll the recommendations included in this document \\nwill require review by national, regional and \\nlocal health system planners to ensure they are \\nadapted, resourced and integrated into maternal, \\nnewborn and child health programmes. Several \\nrecommendations that are highlighted below \\nwill require a broad health systems approach \\nand a strengthened focus on continuity of care, \\nintegrated service delivery, availability of supplies \\nand commodities and empowered health workers. \\nImplementation considerations for the WHO model \\ncan be found in Box 4.1.\\nIn particular, the GDG considered the first two weeks \\nafter birth a key time to identify health problems and \\nto support transition to well-woman and well-infant \\ncare. This current guideline confirms the importance \\nof postnatal care during the first 24 hours after \\nbirth, regardless of the place of birth, and more \\nspecifically recommends a minimum 24-hour stay \\nafter birth in the health facility, with continuous care \\nand monitoring during that stay (Recommendation \\n45). Expanded criteria before discharge have \\nbeen identified to assess and manage potential \\nproblems and to prepare the transition to the home \\n(Recommendations 46 and 47). \\nWhether the health system is set up for a home visit \\nin the first week, or the woman and newborn need to \\nseek routine outpatient postnatal care at the health \\nfacility or in the community, national discussions are \\nencouraged to address the barriers and facilitators \\nto ensure these critical contacts happen. A home \\nvisit for postnatal care within the first two days after \\nbirth, where feasible, has again been highlighted as \\ncritical to reduce mortality and morbidity, and to \\nsupport the transition to the home. Some women and \\nnewborns will require additional contacts, or referral \\nto specialized care, based on their health and needs.'),\n",

It also discusses the value of implementing such \\nprogrammes in an integrated fashion and with the adequate quality and \\nintensity. It is the first time that WHO provides such a summary, organized by stage of the life \\ncourse. \\nMost of the guidelines mentioned in the document (14 out of 24) have been recently developed \\nor updated following the new WHO guideline process, i.e. in ways consistent with best practice, \\nemphasizing the appropriate use of evidence. Systematic reviews of evidence are prepared to \\naddress critical outcomes for decision-making with consideration of the overall balance of risks \\nand benefits, values and preferences, and costs. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, \\nDevelopment and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology is used for assessing the quality of the \\nevidence and the strength of the recommendations. The whole process is implemented by WHO \\ntogether with experts of a high professional standard and devoid of conflict of interest, with oversight \\nby the WHO Guidelines Review Committee.\\nIn order to provide real time updates, WHO launched in 2011 the electronic Library of Evidence \\non Nutrition Actions (eLENA 2). eLENA is a simple web-based tool for academics, policy-makers, \\nhealth workers, and development partners containing links to WHO evidence-informed nutrition \\nrecommendations and the underlying evidence. eLENA also includes topics on which evidence has \\nstarted to accumulate but are still not the object of WHO guidance.\\nThe guideline process does not end with the publication of a document, but continues with \\ndissemination and assistance to policy-makers to adapt the guidance to the country context. \\nAdditional operational tools are often required, including analysis of cost and cost-effectiveness. \\nCosting is addressed by the OneHealth software, developed jointly by various United Nations \\nagencies and the World Bank. 3\\nThe importance of implementing at scale only interventions that have established evidence has \\nbeen stressed by the first series on maternal and child undernutrition published by the Lancet.4 \\nThis document is published simultaneously with a second Lancet series, providing an update of \\nthe evidence base of programmes.

While most nutrition interventions are delivered through the health \\nsector, non-health interventions can also be critical. Actions should target the different causes to \\nreach sustainable change, which requires a multisectoral approach. \\nThis document provides a compact summary of WHO guidance on nutrition interventions targeting \\nthe first 1000 days of life. Focusing on this package of essential nutrition actions, policy-makers \\ncould reduce infant and child mortality, improve physical and mental growth and development, \\nand improve productivity. \\nPart I  presents the interventions currently recommended by WHO (see table on pages 8 to \\n9), summarizes the rationale and the evidence for each, and describes the actions required to \\nimplement them. The document uses a life-course approach, from pre-conception throughout the \\nfirst two years of life.\\nSome interventions require adequate behaviours, such as initiating breastfeeding soon after \\ndelivery, breastfeeding exclusively for six months and then continuing breastfeeding until two \\nyears and beyond. In order for those interventions to be successfully established action is needed \\nto promote healthy behaviours; to create a supportive environment, such as a conducive hospital \\nenvironment, skilled health workers, support in the community and the workplace; and protection \\nfrom commercial and other negative influences.\\nOther interventions require the provision of supplies in adequate amounts for all those in need \\nof them: iron and folic acid supplements, vitamin A supplements, multiple micronutrient powders \\nand ready-to-use therapeutic foods. \\nThe document highlights the circumstances in which the interventions have to be delivered, \\nsuch as the prevalence of different nutrition conditions, or the occurrence of special situations, \\nsuch as the presence of underlying disease (HIV infection, measles, diarrhoea) and emergency \\ncircumstances\\nThe document deals with interventions delivered through the health sector, while recognizing \\nthat other interventions delivered through a variety of sectors (agriculture, water and sanitation, \\neducation, etc.) also have important impacts on nutrition. A special mention is made of food \\nfortification, an intervention that requires the involvement of the health sector and actors in the \\nfood system.\\nPart II provides an analysis of community-based interventions aimed at improving nutrition and \\nindicates how effective interventions can be delivered in an integrated fashion. It shows how \\nthe essential nutrition actions described in the first part have been implemented in large-scale \\nprogrammes in various settings, what the outcomes have been, and to examine the evidence for \\nattribution of changes in nutritional outcomes to programme activities. Some background on the \\nevolution of programmatic evidence is given, and implications for the future are drawn.'),\n",

This situation applies to perinatal and infectious diseases as well as \\nchronic ones. \\nGlobally, in 2011 about 101 million children under 5 years of age were underweight and 165 \\nmillion stunted. At the same time, about 43 million children under 5 were overweight or obese (1). \\nAbout 90% of stunted children live in only 36 countries, and children under 2 years of age are \\nmost affected by undernutrition ( 2).1 Nearly 20 million children under 5 suffer from severe acute \\nmalnutrition, a life-threatening condition requiring urgent treatment.\\nIn 2011, 6.9 million children under 5 died, mostly from preventable causes such as pneumonia, \\ndiarrhoea, malaria and neonatal conditions (3, 4) (Figure 1); about 90% of these deaths occurred \\nin 42 countries, with half the worldwide deaths occurring in only 6 countries ( 5). Undernutrition \\nis associated with more than one third of those deaths ( 2, 6).\\nImprovement of exclusive breastfeeding practices, adequate and timely complementary feeding, \\nalong with continued breastfeeding for up to 2 years or beyond, could save the lives of 1.5 million \\nchildren under 5 years of age annually (7). Growth failure during intrauterine life and poor nutrition \\nin the first two years of life have critical consequences throughout the life-course. Appropriate \\nbreastfeeding and complementary feeding practices not only play a significant role in improving \\nthe health and nutrition of young children, they also confer significant long-term benefits during \\nadolescence and adulthood. An estimated 13 million children are born with intrauterine growth \\nrestriction every year ( 2).1 \\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 190 million children under five \\n(33.3% of the preschool age population) are vitamin A deficient, with about 5.2 million affected \\nby night blindness (9). Infants as well as young children have increased vitamin A requirements to \\n1 These figures will be updated as this report is published.\\nFigure 1.

Severe vitamin A deficiency (VAD) at this age can \\ncause visual impairments, anaemia and weakened immunity, with an increased risk of morbidity \\nand mortality from measles or diarrhoea ( 10). \\nVAD is also an issue for women. WHO estimates that 9.8 million women are affected by night \\nblindness, a problem related with insufficient vitamin A ( 11). \\nIron is the most common nutritional deficiency, with approximately 2 billion people worldwide \\naffected (12). WHO estimates that there are 469 million women of reproductive age and about \\n600 million preschool and school-age children worldwide anaemic, with at least half of these \\ncases attributable to iron deficiency (iron deficiency anaemia) ( 13).\\nInfants and children under the age of five are at risk of developing iron deficiency anaemia because \\nof their increased requirements for rapid growth and diets that are often lacking in sufficient \\nabsorbable iron ( 14, 15). Iron deficiency, with or without anaemia, may have important health \\nconsequences for young children, including increased perinatal mortality, delayed mental and \\nphysical development, negative behavioural consequences, reduced auditory and visual function, \\nand impaired physical performance ( 16). Some of the negative effects of iron deficiency during \\nearly childhood are irreversible and can lead to poor school performance, reduced physical work \\ncapacity and decreased productivity later in life ( 3, 11, 17, 18, 19).\\nMaternal short stature and iron deficiency anaemia, which can increase the risk of death of the \\nmother at delivery, contribute to at least 18% of maternal deaths in low- and middle-income \\ncountries ( 20). Anaemia rates have not improved appreciably over the past two decades ( 21). \\nMaternal undernutrition also increases the probability of low birth weight, which in turn increases \\nthe probability of neonatal deaths due to infections and asphyxia (22). Anaemia is also associated \\nwith an increased risk of maternal mortality ( 23). Globally, almost 50% of pregnant women \\n(56 million) are anaemic ( 4). Because adolescent girls and women of reproductive age lose \\niron through monthly menstruation, and because their diets are often lacking in iron, they are \\nparticularly vulnerable to iron deficiency ( 10, 23, 24).\\nIn 2008, 35% of adults aged 20 years and older were overweight (body-mass index [BMI] ≥ \\n25 kg/m2) (34% of men and 35% of women). The worldwide prevalence of obesity has nearly \\ndoubled between 1980 and 2008. In 2008, 14% of women in the world were obese (BMI ≥30 \\nkg/m2) (297 million over the age of 20), compared with 8% in 1980 ( 25, 26). \\nCauses of malnutrition\\nThe causes of malnutrition are directly related to inadequate dietary intake as well as disease, but \\nindirectly to many factors, among others household food security, maternal and child care, health \\nservices and the environment. While most nutrition interventions are delivered through the health \\nsector, non-health interventions can also be critical. Actions should target the different causes to \\nreach sustainable change, which requires a multisectoral approach. \\nTiming of interventions\\nNew analyses, using the WHO Growth Standards ( 27), confirm the importance of the first two \\nyears of life as a window of opportunity for growth promotion ( Figure 2). An important feature of \\nthe WHO standards is that they reveal a much greater problem of undernutrition during the first \\nsix months of life than previously believed, bringing coherence between the rates of undernutrition \\nobserved in young infants and the prevalence of low birth weight and early abandonment of \\nexclusive breastfeeding. These findings highlight the need for prenatal and early-life interventions \\nto prevent the growth failure that primarily happens during the first two years of life, including \\nthe promotion of appropriate infant feeding practices ( 28). The deficits acquired by this age are \\ndifficult to reverse later.\\nStrategies to improve nutritional status and growth in children should include interventions to \\nimprove nutrition of pregnant and lactating women; early initiation of breastfeeding with exclusive \\nbreastfeeding for six months; promotion, protection, and support of continued breastfeeding'),\n",

In strengthening its commitment to providing relevant guidance for \\nprogrammes that support and develop capacity in evidence-informed policy-making to Member \\nStates, the WHO Department of Nutrition for Health and Development recently established \\nthe WHO Nutrition Guidance Expert Advisory Group with experts from WHO Advisory Panels \\nand other experts in the fields of epidemiology, nutrition, public health, paediatric medicine, and \\nprogramme implementation.

Interventions targeted at young \\ninfants (0–5 months)1\\n1.1 Early initiation of breastfeeding\\nWHO RECOMMENDATION\\nPlace babies in skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately following birth for \\nat least an hour and encourage mothers to recognize when their babies are ready to \\nbreastfeed, offering help if needed. ( 1)\\nRationale and evidence\\nWHO and UNICEF provided recommendations on early initiation of breastfeeding in 1989, and the \\nevidence was updated in 1998. Evidence for the importance of early initiation was systematically \\nreviewed again in 2007, in the context of early skin-to-skin contact. The review found a positive \\neffect on both the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for one to four months of life, and \\nthe overall duration of breastfeeding, when mothers put the infant to the breast soon after birth. \\nThe review also showed that babies interacted more with their mothers, stayed warmer and cried \\nless (2). A Cochrane review on community-based integrated packages to improve maternal and \\nneonatal health found that community-based programming had a positive impact on the initiation \\nof breastfeeding within one hour of birth ( 3). \\nEarly initiation promotes exclusiveness and duration of breastfeeding, but the relationship between \\nearly initiation of breastfeeding and improved health has not been so well established. However, a \\nrecent study in Ghana (4) showed evidence of a causal association between early breastfeeding \\nand reduced infection-specific neonatal mortality in young human infants.\\nThe recommendation for early initiation of breastfeeding stems from the 1989 WHO/UNICEF \\nJoint Statement Protecting, promoting and supporting breast-feeding: the special role of maternity \\nservices (5). An updated 1998 statement includes the ten steps for successful breastfeeding, \\nwith Step 4 indicating “Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within a half-hour of birth”. The updated \\nreview concluded that early contact increases breastfeeding both soon after delivery and two to \\nthree months later. Spontaneous suckling may not occur until between 45 minutes to 2 hours \\nafter birth, but skin-to-skin contact should start as soon as possible after delivery. Provided the \\ninfant is in close contact with his/her mother and can suckle when it shows signs of readiness, \\nthere is no justification for forcing him/her to take the breast ( 6). \\nA Cochrane systematic review ( 2) suggested that in industrialized societies, hospital routines \\nmay significantly disrupt early mother-infant interactions with harmful effects. It also showed that \\nbabies interacted more with their mothers, stayed warmer and cried less with early skin-to-skin \\ncontact. Babies were more likely to be breastfed, and to breastfeed for longer.\\n(For a summary of systematic reviews on early initiation of breastfeeding, see Table I-1.)\\n1 0–5 months refers to the period up to 180 days of life.'),\n",

( 7)\\nRationale and evidence\\nOne of the most effective and rewarding preventable interventions is breastfeeding, which \\ntogether with appropriate complementary feeding has the potential to reduce mortality among \\nchildren under five by 19% (8). Six months of EBF is recommended for improved infant, child, and \\nmaternal health. EBF from birth is possible except for a few medical conditions, and unrestricted \\nEBF results in ample milk production. The evidence stems from a systematic review in 2001 on \\nthe effects of EBF for six (versus three to four) months on infant and maternal health. The review \\nfound evidence of decreased gastrointestinal illnesses in infants who were exclusively breastfed \\nfor six months (compared to those who were mixed breastfed – receiving breast milk and other \\nmilk – at three to four months), and also that mothers who exclusively breastfed for six months \\nexperience prolonged lactational amenorrhea ( 9).\\nAn expert consultation in 2001 served to analyse the systematic review as well as to review the \\nnutrient adequacy of EBF ( 10) for six months ( 7). Based on the results, WHO recommended \\n“exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with introduction of complementary foods and continued \\nbreastfeeding thereafter” ( 11).\\nThe 2001 systematic review was updated to include six additional studies and was published in \\n2009 (12). The nearly identical results to those found previously reinforced WHO’s recommen -\\ndation of six months of EBF for improved health.\\n(For a summary of systematic reviews on EBF, see Table I-2.)\\nActions to protect, promote and support breastfeeding\\nThe Global strategy for infant and young child feeding , adopted by the World Health Assembly \\n(WHA) and the UNICEF Executive Board in 2002, provides the framework for action to protect, \\npromote and support breastfeeding.

The main elements of the Code deal with information \\nand education; advertising and promotions to mothers and health workers; labelling; quality; and \\nimplementation and monitoring. \\nTo maximize the contribution that the Code can make to improved breastfeeding, given the many \\nexamples of non-compliance, in-country monitoring of its implementation should be carried out \\n(17, 18). Companies found to be committing violations should be sanctioned by the government \\nentity charged with Code enforcement. Having all companies that produce infant formula compete \\nfor market share in a manner consistent with the Code will benefit these companies by ensuring \\nthat no company is given an unfair advantage ( 19). \\nImproving maternity protection and health through the workplace\\nMaternity protection at work is essential for safe-guarding the health and economic security of \\nwomen and their children. This consensus is reflected in the international labour standards of \\nthe ILO, which set out basic requirements for maternity protection at work. Many countries have \\nratified Maternity Protection Convention No. 183, and others have adopted some of its provisions \\n(20). Health professionals have an important role to play in advocating for good legislation on \\nmaternity protection, and hospitals and other health facilities should offer maternity leave and \\nbreastfeeding support for their own personnel. All working women should be supported to \\nsustain breastfeeding when they return to work, and in the workplace they should be granted a \\nminimum of one daily break with pay, to breastfeed their infant or express and store breast milk \\n(21, 22, 23, 24). \\nBaby-friendly Hospital Initiative (1, 25, 26) \\nWHO conducted a review of the evidence to support the implementation of the Ten steps for \\nsuccessful breastfeeding  (27) and an update is underway. A review on interventions to promote \\nbreastfeeding found that BFHI is effective in increasing EBF rates (28). The BFHI has a systematic \\nrecertification process to ensure that its rigorous standards are upheld. Many hospitals that \\nwere certified in the past no longer meet the criteria and require recertification. Revitalization \\nof the BFHI also requires capacity building in breastfeeding counselling and clinical aspects \\nof lactation management. To enforce the monitoring of the BFHI criteria on a routine basis, \\nconsideration should be given to making fulfilment of the criteria a part of the overall system of \\nquality certification of hospitals ( 29).\\nCounselling and support for appropriate breastfeeding at community and facility level\\nOne-on-one breastfeeding counselling is particularly effective in promoting EBF. Maternal \\ncounselling during pregnancy, immediately after child birth and at key moments in the postnatal \\nperiod has large and significant effects on EBF rates. The evidence of the effect of interventions on \\nbreastfeeding practices is less clear than the biological and behavioural effects of breastfeeding on \\nhealth. Best practices to increase EBF, and thus improve health, were reviewed in a Lancet series \\non maternal and child undernutrition (30). The review showed counselling is particularly effective \\nin promoting EBF. As compared to control groups, EBF increased among mothers during the \\nneonatal period (OR 3.45, 95% CI 2.20–5.42) and at 6 months of age (OR 1.39, CI 1.18–3.15) \\nwhen exposed to individual, one-on-one counselling. Group counselling was shown to increase \\nEBF during the neonatal period (OR 3.88, CI 2.09–7.22) and at 6 months of age (OR 5.19, CI \\n1.90–14.15) compared to control groups. Maternal counselling during pregnancy, immediately \\nafter childbirth and at key moments in the postnatal period had large and significant effects on \\nEBF. Promotion of breastfeeding through mass media was shown effective at increasing EBF \\nduring the 6-month postnatal period by between 7% and 70% in the exposed population, with \\nthe largest impact seen in mothers with infants 1 to 4 months of age ( 13).

This evidence \\nhas had major implications for how women living with HIV should feed their infants and how \\nhealth workers should counsel and support them. \\nNine key principles underlie the seven evidence-based recommendations above. The principles \\nreflect a set of values that contextualize the provision of care in programmatic settings. The key \\nprinciples are directed towards policy-makers, academics and health workers.\\nKEY PRINCIPLES ON HIV AND INFANT FEEDING\\n1. Balancing HIV prevention with protection from other causes of child mortality.\\n2.  Integrating HIV interventions into maternal and child health services.\\n3.  Setting national or sub-national recommendations for infant feeding in the context of \\nHIV.\\n4.  When ARVs are not (immediately) available, breastfeeding may still provide infants \\nborn to HIV-infected mothers with a greater chance of HIV-free survival.\\n5.  Informing mothers known to be HIV infected about infant feeding alternatives.\\n6.  Providing services to specifically support mothers to appropriately feed their infants.\\n7.  Avoiding harm to infant feeding practices in the general population.\\n8.  Advising mothers who are HIV uninfected or whose HIV status is unknown.\\n9.  Investing in improvement in infant feeding practices in the context of HIV.\\nRecommendation 1 is based on the revised WHO recommendations for ARV therapy or \\nprophylaxis to reduce HIV transmission, including through breastfeeding ( 35). \\nRecommendation 2 is based on a systematic review of the effect of different infant feeding \\npractices, in the absence of ARVs, on HIV-free survival and other mortality. Decreased HIV \\ntransmission in the first six months of infant life was associated with EBF compared to mixed \\nfeeding. EBF in the first six months of life was also associated with reduced mortality over the \\nfirst year of life in HIV-exposed infants. The risk of HIV transmission continues for as long as \\nbreastfeeding continues; despite this, HIV-free survival of HIV-exposed infants who breastfed \\nbeyond six months of age was better than of infants who were started on replacement feeds.\\nRecommendation 3 is based on research and programmatic experience reporting that rapid and \\nabrupt cessation of breastfeeding was very difficult for mothers to achieve and was associated \\nwith adverse consequences for the infant; breast-milk viral load is also known to spike with rapid \\ncessation of breastfeeding.\\nFor Recommendation 4, the very considerable evidence from non HIV-exposed populations was \\nrelevant and justifiable to use to inform how HIV-infected mothers should feed their infants in the \\nabsence of breast milk. Alternatives to breastfeeding include:\\nFor infants less than six months of age:\\n■■ commercial infant formula milk as long as home conditions outlined in Recommendation 5 are \\nfulfilled;\\n■■ expressed, heat-treated breast milk.'),\n",

Breastfed children at 12–23 months of age receive on average 35% to 40% of total energy \\nneeds from breast milk ( 39) with the remaining 60% to 65% covered by complementary foods. \\nBreast milk is a key source of energy and essential fatty acids and provides substantial amounts \\nof certain micronutrients. The nutritional impact of breastfeeding is most evident during periods \\nof illness, when the child’s appetite for other foods decreases but breast-milk intake is maintained \\n(40). Continued, frequent breastfeeding also protects child health by delaying maternal fertility \\npostpartum and reducing the child’s risk of morbidity and mortality in disadvantaged populations \\n(41, 42). Longitudinal studies demonstrate that in developing countries, a longer duration of \\nbreastfeeding is associated with greater linear growth ( 43, 44 ). It is also linked to reduced \\nrisk of childhood chronic illnesses ( 45) and obesity ( 46) and to improved cognitive outcomes \\n(47), although the causal relationship underlying these associations remains controversial. \\nBreastfeeding in the first 6 months of life provides greater protection against diarrhoea than \\nagainst acute respiratory illness (OR=6.1 vs. OR=2.4), but breastfeeding between 6–11 months \\nshows “similar levels of protection” against both acute respiratory illness and diarrhoea (OR=1.9 \\nvs. OR=2.5) (3 studies) ( 42).

A working definition refers to complementary \\nfeeding as the process starting when breast milk or infant formula alone is no longer sufficient \\nto meet the nutritional requirements of infants, and therefore other foods and liquids are needed, \\nalong with breast milk or a breast-milk substitute. The target range for complementary feeding is \\ngenerally taken to be 6 to 23 months (16, 49, 50). \\nA critical window of opportunity to ensure optimal child growth and development covers the \\nperiod of pregnancy up to the second year of life ( 51, 52). Successful complementary feeding \\nis critical for preventing malnutrition. Growth faltering is most evident during this time period, \\nparticularly between 6 and 12 months when foods of low nutrient density begin to replace breast \\nmilk and rates of diarrhoeal illness caused by food contamination are at their highest. After about \\ntwo years of age, it is very difficult to reverse stunting that occurred at earlier ages. \\nThe evidence that feeding practices and diet affect growth and development of children (sequence \\n1 in Figure I-1) is summarized by WHO (53) and others, especially Dewey and Brown (39). The \\nrelationship of nutrient requirements, feeding frequency, energy density and feeding practices to \\nadequate growth and development is considered well supported by the available evidence, which \\nincludes clearly understood mechanisms. \\nFigure I-1 How feeding practices and diet affect growth and development 1\\nIntervention, e.g.\\n• Counselling\\n• Technology\\n• Provision of additional\\n food\\nIntermediate outcome, e.g.\\n• Feeding practices\\n• Diet quantity and quality\\nHealth/nutritional outcomes\\n• Child growth and development\\n3\\n2 1\\nThe main issues have become how to optimize these practices (intermediate outcomes) with \\ninterventions (sequence 2 in Figure I-1).

In addition to iron, vitamin A and zinc, multiple micronutrient powders may contain other \\nvitamins and minerals at currently recommended nutrient intake (RNI) doses for the target population ( 60). \\nb 12.5 mg of elemental iron equals 37.5 mg of ferrous fumarate, 62.5 mg of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate or 105 mg of \\nferrous gluconate.\\nRationale and evidence\\nIn lower-income settings, children’s diets may be primarily plant-based. A lack of animal-source \\nfoods in these settings results in insufficient amounts of key micronutrients such as vitamin A, \\nzinc, and iron, to meet the recommended intakes for children less than 24 months of age. WHO \\nestimates globally that 190 million preschool children are vitamin A deficient ( 61) and more than \\ntwo thirds of children are anaemic in Africa and south-east Asia. Infants and young children \\nare also most susceptible to the harmful consequences of these deficiencies. A compromised \\nimmune status resulting from poor nutritional status can directly lead to an increased risk of \\ninfectious diseases and potentially elevated rates of infant morbidity and mortality ( 62). \\nSupplementation has been proposed as one of the best available nutrition interventions to address \\nthese vitamin and mineral deficiencies, as it can be targeted to some of the most vulnerable \\npopulation groups, such as those living in remote regions, as well as young children ( 63). The \\nMNPs were developed as an alternative to supplementation and have shown to be successful \\nin reducing anaemia and iron deficiency in young children in a variety of contexts as they can \\nbe added directly to food ( 64, 65 ). MNPs are frequently packaged in small sachets which are \\ntemperature and moisture resistant ( 66), giving them a long shelf-life and easing transportation \\nand storage problems (67). These characteristics reduce the frequency of distribution necessary \\nto maintain a supply of micronutrients ( 68). \\nMild side effects can occur with supplementation, such as darkened stools, gastrointestinal pain, \\ndiarrhoea, constipation and vomiting (69). Though MNPs do not eliminate these side effects, they \\ndo appear to reduce their frequency and severity and are highly acceptable ( 70). Iron is covered \\nin a fat-based protective coating so that the taste, colour and aroma of food change minimally \\nwithout greatly affecting children’s dietary habits.The fortification of foods using MNPs can be \\ndone at home or any other locations where meals are prepared and consumed, such as schools \\nor hospitals. This method of fortification is thus referred to as point-of-use ( 71).'),\n",

In total eight trials \\nincluding children living in a variety of settings were evaluated. When compared to no intervention, \\nhome fortification with MNPs was found to reduce anaemia by 32% and iron deficiency by 50% \\nin infants and young children.

The role of vitamin A in immunity may also \\naffect the susceptibility and/or severity of other infections ( 79, 80). \\nMany countries have integrated vitamin A supplementation for infants and children into national \\nhealth policies and routine health services, for example through biannual ”special days” where \\nsupplementation is combined with other child survival interventions such as deworming or \\nnutrition education (81, 82). Vitamin A supplements are also commonly distributed as part of the \\nExpanded Programme on Immunization, particularly at nine months with measles vaccinations. In \\n2009, approximately 77% of preschool children were estimated to have received two doses of \\nsupplements per year in more than 103 priority countries ( 83). \\nProvision of a high dose of vitamin A every six months until the age of five years has been based \\non the principle that a single high dose of vitamin A is highly absorbed, stored as a fat-soluble \\nvitamin in the liver and mobilized over an extended period of time as needed. In infants 6–11 \\nmonths of age doses of 100 000 IU and in children 12–59 months of age 200 000 IU have been \\nconsidered to provide adequate protection for 4 to 6 months ( 84). Most children in this age \\ngroup tolerate these doses of vitamin A well, though temporary side effects such as headache, \\nnausea or vomiting and diarrhoea have been reported in a small percentage of cases ( 85). On \\na per-child basis, the cost of vitamin A supplementation is considered inexpensive. Most of the \\nvitamin A used during supplementation campaigns is supplied in gelatin capsules, which cost \\napproximately US$ 0.02 each ( 86), with an estimated cost of US$ 1 to US$ 2 for delivery per \\nchild per year. The total cost of supplementation per death averted is estimated at US$ 200 to \\nUS$ 250 (87). \\nTwo Cochrane reviews were recently updated to systematically evaluate the most recent \\nevidence on vitamin A supplementation in children ( 77, 88). The first examined the effects and \\nsafety of vitamin A supplementation for the prevention of morbidity and mortality among children \\n6–59 months of age (77). Results of the review showed that supplementation with vitamin A can \\nreduce mortality and the prevalence rates of communicable diseases such as diarrhoea. The \\nmeta-analysis included 17 clinical trials and indicated that vitamin A supplementation reduces the \\nrisk of all-cause mortality by 24%. Another review assessed the effects and safety of a number \\nof micronutrients, including vitamin A, in reducing morbidity and mortality for children and adults \\nwith HIV. This review included five trials on vitamin A supplementation in children and only three \\n(all in Africa) contributed data on all-cause mortality. The data suggest that periodic vitamin A \\nsupplementation of HIV-infected children over six months of age is beneficial in reducing overall \\nmortality risk.\\nActions to promote vitamin A supplementation for children\\nIn 1997, WHO recommended universal vitamin A distribution, involving periodic administration \\nof supplemental doses to all preschool-age children, with priority given to age groups (usually six \\nmonths to three years) or regions at greatest risk of VAD, xerophthalmia, and nutritional blindness \\n(81).\\nVitamin A supplements should be delivered to children 6–59 months of age twice yearly, during \\nhealth system contacts. Where appropriate, supplements should be integrated into other \\npublic health programmes aimed at improving child survival, such as polio or measles national \\nimmunization days, or biannual child health days delivering a package of interventions such as \\ndeworming, distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and immunizations ( 82).

In \\naddition, measles infection may precipitate acute VAD and xerophtalmia. As a result, measles \\naccounts for a large proportion of preventable childhood blindness, particularly in Africa.\\nThe beneficial impact of two doses of vitamin A during treatment of measles is well established. \\nWHO’s current policy advocates administering vitamin A to all acute cases.

They are normally born with good iron stores. However, beyond \\nsix months of age the iron content of milk is not sufficient to meet many infants’ \\nrequirements, and unfortified complementary foods are usually low in iron, making this \\nage group susceptible to iron deficiency. LBW infants are born with fewer iron stores \\nand thus are at higher risk of developing iron deficiency at a younger age. Where the diet \\ndoes not include fortified foods, or prevalence of anaemia in children at approximately \\n1 year of age is severe (above 40%), supplements of iron at a dosage of 2 mg/kg of body \\nweight per day should be given to all children between 6 and 23 months of age.

Intermittent doses once, twice or three times per \\nweek (90) on non-consecutive days may be an alternative to daily supplementation to improve \\niron stores and prevent anaemia ( 91). \\nA Cochrane systematic review assessed the benefits and safety of intermittent iron supplementation \\nwith iron, or iron combined with other micronutrients for children up to the age of 12 years (90). A \\ntotal of 23 randomized controlled trials were included in the review that compared providing iron \\nsupplements to either no intervention, receiving a placebo or daily iron supplementation with the \\nsame nutrients among children living in various geographical settings, including malaria-endemic \\nregions.

Every year more than one million children under five years of age succumb to the \\nfluid loss and dehydration associated with the majority of diarrhoea-related deaths. It is estimated \\nthat 13% of all years lost due to ill-health, disability, or early death are caused by diarrhoea ( 101, \\n102, 103, 104).\\nOral rehydration is a well-known and relatively simple treatment approach (105, 106, 107, 108, 109, \\n110, 111). Oral rehydration salts (ORS), and particularly the low osmolarity formula, are a proven \\nlife-saving commodity for the treatment of children with diarrhoea. Use of zinc supplements with \\nORS to treat children with diarrhoea reduces deaths in children less than five years of age ( 112). \\nZinc for the treatment of diarrhoea reduces diarrhoea mortality by 23% ( 113) and is associated \\nwith a 14–15% reduction in incidence of pneumonia or diarrhoea (114). Use of zinc supplements \\nhas been found to reduce the duration and severity of diarrhoeal episodes and the likelihood of \\nsubsequent infections for two to three months (115, 116 , 117, 118). At the recommended dose zinc \\nsupplements are generally accepted by both children and caregivers and are effective regardless \\nof the type of zinc salt used ( 119, 120). Supplementary zinc benefits children with diarrhoea \\nbecause it is a vital micronutrient essential for protein synthesis, cell growth and differentiation, \\nimmune function and intestinal transport of water and electrolytes ( 121, 122, 123, 124). Zinc is \\nan essential micronutrient and protects cell membranes from oxidative damage ( 125). It is also \\nimportant for normal growth and development of children both with and without diarrhoea ( 126, \\n127, 128). Zinc deficiency is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal infections, \\nadverse effects on the structure and function of the gastrointestinal tract, and impaired immune \\nfunction (125, 129, 130, 131). Dietary deficiency of zinc is especially common in lower-income \\ncountries because of a low dietary intake of zinc-rich foods (mainly foods of animal origin) or \\ninadequate absorption caused by its binding to dietary fibre and phytates often found in cereals, \\nnuts and legumes (132, 133). \\nActions to promote use of zinc as part of diarrhoea treatment (134)\\nPolicy issues will need to be resolved in order to remove barriers to scaling-up. These include:\\n■■ empowering community level workers to manage pneumonia with antibiotics as well as use of \\nzinc in diarrhoea case management; \\n■■ improving outreach and service linkages with communities to raise immunization coverage; \\nand \\n■■ considering use of new vaccine delivery devices or use of more heat-stable vaccines.\\nAlthough the benefits of zinc supplementation in the management of diarrhoea have been \\nestablished (135), a number of barriers to the widespread implementation of this strategy remain \\n(136) and have to be addressed, for example:\\n■■ dissemination of information and advocacy with physicians and health workers in developing \\ncountries; \\n■■ integration of the use of zinc for diarrhoea treatment in national policies; \\n■■ ensuring availability of zinc for diarrhoea in sufficient quantities or as an appropriate formulation \\nfor children;'),\n",

This implies that the child is exclusively breastfed and that the lactating \\nmother received iodine supplementation as recommended ( 137). \\nRationale and evidence\\nBased on new evidence and lessons learned within the last decade, it appears that the groups \\nmost susceptible to iodine deficiency, including children less than two years of age, might not be \\nadequately covered by iodized salt where Universal Salt Iodization (USI) is not fully implemented. \\nThis situation may jeopardize the optimal brain development of the fetus and young child. \\nIrrespective of where countries, or areas within countries, are categorized with regard to USI, \\nthere are specific situations, such as in emergencies, among displaced people and geographically \\nremote areas, where iodized salt may not be accessible.

Children with bilateral pitting oedema are also considered as having SAM. \\nMid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) can be used as an independent criterion for \\nidentification of children 6–60 months old with SAM, with the cut-off point of 115 mm \\n(138).\\nRationale and evidence \\nChildren below -3 SD of the WHO standards for weight-for-height have a highly elevated risk \\nof death compared to those who are above. These children have a higher weight gain when \\nreceiving a therapeutic diet compared to other diets, which results in faster recovery. There are \\nno known risks or negative effects associated with therapeutic feeding of these children applying \\nrecommended protocols and appropriate therapeutic foods. \\nWHO standards for MUAC-for-age show that in a well-nourished population there are very few \\nchildren aged 6–60 months with a MUAC less than 115 mm. Children with a MUAC less than 115 \\nmm have a highly elevated risk of death compared to those who are above.\\nWHO RECOMMENDATION FOR OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT \\nOF CHILDREN WITH SAM\\nChildren 6 months or older with SAM, appetite and no medical complications can be \\nmanaged in the community with regular visits to a health centre. ( 138, 139)\\nRationale and evidence \\nNew evidence suggests that large numbers of children with SAM can be treated in their commu -\\nnities without being admitted to a health facility or a therapeutic feeding centre.\\nThe community-based approach involves timely detection of SAM in the community and provision \\nof treatment for those without medical complications with ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF) \\nor other nutrient-dense foods at home and regular medical monitoring at a health facility. If \\nproperly combined with a facility-based approach for those malnourished children with medical \\ncomplications or below six months of age and implemented on a large scale, community-based \\nmanagement of SAM could prevent the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children ( 139). \\nSAM in children can be identified in the community before the onset of complications by CHWs \\nor volunteers using simple coloured plastic strips that are designed to measure MUAC. They can \\nalso be trained to recognize bilateral oedema of the feet, another sign of this condition.\\nUncomplicated forms of SAM should be treated in the community using an RUTF until adequate \\nweight has been gained. In some settings it may be possible to construct an appropriate therapeutic \\ndiet using locally available nutrient-dense foods with added micronutrient supplements. In addition \\nto the provision of RUTF, children need to receive a short course of basic oral medication to treat \\ninfections and need to be regularly monitored for danger signs of deterioration ( 140).'),\n",

RUTF are soft or crushable foods that can be consumed easily by \\nchildren from the age of six months. RUTF have a similar nutrient composition to F100, which is \\nthe therapeutic diet used in hospital settings, except for its iron content. Unlike F100, RUTF are \\nnot water-based, meaning that bacteria cannot grow in them. Therefore these foods can be used \\nsafely at home without refrigeration, even in areas where hygiene conditions are not optimal. As \\na result, more opportunities now exist for severely malnourished children to be discharged early \\nfrom hospital for continuing care in the community.\\nEvidence shows that RUTF home/outpatient therapy is successful ( 141, 142, 143), and that the \\nproduction of RUTF spreads is easy and safe in most settings worldwide ( 144). For this reason, \\nWHO developed international standards for the manufacturing of RUTF which give guidance for \\nlocal production; these include detailed nutrition composition and safety measures.\\nWHO RECOMMENDATION FOR INPATIENT MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN \\nWITH SAM\\nChildren 6 months or older with SAM, no appetite or with medical complications should \\nbe hospitalized for inpatient management ( 138).\\nRationale and evidence\\nWhile the figures on SAM show worrying trends, the implementation of the developed WHO \\nprotocol for facility-based management of SAM has improved the quality of hospital care.\\nThe establishment of community-based management of severe malnutrition within routine health \\nsystems is strongly justified in the literature. Indeed, malnourished children, their families and health \\nsystems could benefit from this type of management. When treated in the community, children \\nare less at risk of acquiring hospital infections. Family members caring for the malnourished child \\ncan spend less time away from home, and thus the opportunity cost of treatment is reduced. \\nHealth systems could reduce costs since hospitals would admit fewer cases and keep them for \\nshorter stays, and potentially increase coverage rates ( 145, 146, 147). Evidence suggests that \\nwith capacity built for inpatient, outpatient care and follow-up after discharge, case fatality rates \\ncan be as low as 5%, both in the community and in health facilities. \\nThe implementation of the WHO guidelines has the potential to save many of the lives currently \\nbeing lost through severe malnutrition and to contribute substantially to achieving the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goal of reducing child mortality.\\nActions for appropriate inpatient management of children with SAM\\nAppropriate therapy \\nA manual was developed by WHO in 1999 (148) to provide practical guidelines for the manage -\\nment of patients – mainly children below five years of age – with severe malnutrition in hospitals \\nand health centres. 1 It seeks to promote the best available therapy so as to reduce the risk of \\ndeath, shorten the length of time spent in hospital, and facilitate rehabilitation and full recovery. \\nThe management of the child with severe malnutrition is divided into four phases:\\n■■ Stabilization phase: for children with SAM and medical complications, life-threatening problems \\nare identified and treated in a hospital or a residential care facility, specific deficiencies are \\ncorrected, metabolic abnormalities are reversed and therapeutic feeding is begun (F75). 2 The \\nprotocol includes treatment of hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, dehydration with or without septic \\nshock, and severe anaemia, as well as the correction of electrolyte imbalances, treatment of \\ninfection and the correction of micronutrient deficiencies (while excluding iron). 3\\n1 This manual is currently being updated.\\n2 A special formula for treatment of malnourished children (as is F100).\\n3 Iron may be dangerous because transferrin levels are reduced and can become toxic because of reduced capacity \\nof the liver to metabolize.'),\n",

Further research is required \\non the composition, acceptability and use of supplementary foods for the treatment of moderate \\nacute malnutrition for the future development of WHO guidelines. \\n2.11 Nutritional care and support of HIV-infected children 6 months  \\n to 14 years old \\nWHO RECOMMENDATION\\nChildren living with HIV should be assessed, classified and managed according to a \\nnutrition care plan to cover their nutrient needs associated with the presence of HIV and \\nnutritional status and to ensure appropriate growth and development ( 151).\\nRationale and evidence (151)\\nAlthough the severe nutritional consequences of HIV infection in adults and children have been \\nrecognized for many years, gaps remain in the evidence base for defining effective interventions \\nto prevent and treat HIV-associated malnutrition in resource-constrained settings. As a result, \\nthe development and implementation of guidelines on how best to offer nutritional care to HIV-\\ninfected children has lagged. The delivery of such care has also been compromised by service \\nprovider’s heavy work burden and need for training, recurring staff losses and weakened health \\ncare systems in HIV-affected settings. \\nIn 2004 WHO commissioned a technical review of the nutritional requirements of adults and \\nchildren infected with HIV as an evidence-base for the development of nutritional care guidelines. \\nThese were presented at the WHO technical consultation on Nutrition and HIV/Acquired \\nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) held in Durban in April 2005, where participants called \\nfor urgent action to “ Develop practical nutrition assessment tools and guidelines for home, \\ncommunity, health facility-based and emergency progammes ”.\\nHIV-infected children deserve special attention because of their additional needs to ensure \\ngrowth and development and their dependency on adults for adequate care, including nutrition \\ncare and support for treatment. This is of particular importance in light of the recommendation \\nto start treatment as soon as possible in infected children and the fact that nutrition plays an \\nimportant role in support to ARV treatment.\\nActions for an integrated approach to the nutritional care of HIV-infected children \\nThe guidelines for an integrated approach to the nutritional care of HIV-infected children provide \\norientation on how to integrate nutritional care into the integrated care of the HIV-infected child; \\nthat orientation is summarized in three sections and ten steps:\\nSection 1. Assess, classify and decide a nutrition care plan.\\nStep 1. Assess and classify the child’s growth, observing and measuring the child, using MUAC \\nfor classification of severe malnutrition and referral, weight-for-height z-score or weight-for-age \\nz-score, according to the WHO growth standards (up to five years) and WHO growth references \\n(from five years onward).'),\n",

In exceptionally difficult circumstances, the focus needs to be on creating \\nconditions that will facilitate breastfeeding, such as establishing safe ‘corners’ for \\nmothers and infants, one-to-one counselling and mother-to-mother support. Traumatized \\nand depressed women may have difficulty responding to their infants and require \\nparticular mental and emotional support. Every effort should be made to identify ways to \\nbreastfeed infants and young children who are separated from their mothers. Breast-milk \\nsubstitutes, milk products, bottles and teats should never be part of a general or blanket \\ndistribution. Dried milk products should be distributed only when pre-mixed with a milled \\nstaple food and should not be distributed as a single commodity. A general food basket \\nshould provide 2100 kcal per person per day and include products fortified with vitamins \\nand minerals. Special focus should also be on early identification and management of \\ninfants and children with acute malnutrition to prevent serious illness and death ( 152, \\n153).\\nRationale and evidence\\nDisruption and displacement of populations in emergency situations greatly impacts on the \\nhealth and nutrition status of infants and young children. Adequate nutrition and care of children \\nhas been identified as one of the key factors to promote child health and stability. Malnutrition \\nis a major threat to child survival during an emergency and for those who survive; it can also \\nhave tremendous consequences on their cognitive, social, motor skill, physical and emotional \\ndevelopment. The best way to prevent malnutrition is to ensure optimal feeding and care for \\nchildren. In the emergency context, displaced or devastated communities are often dependent on \\nthe provision of food aid to meet their basic nutritional requirements. When food aid is provided, \\nissues around food handling, preparation and storage are highlighted because the normal food \\nsystems, including cooking facilities and access to fuel and water, are often disrupted and yet \\nfood must continue to be prepared and eaten. \\nDuring emergencies, the risk of diarrhoea is exacerbated ( 154) and transmission rates soar. \\nPoor access to clean water, poor food hygiene practices, introduction to new or unusual foods,'),\n",

Without proper food support, body \\nreserves of vitamin A become severely depleted. In the emergency context, there is an increase \\nin communicable and infectious diseases due to over-crowded shelter conditions and disruption \\ndue to population displacement and the demise of health infrastructure. Transmission of illnesses \\nsuch as diarrhoea, measles and pneumonia are exacerbated and lead to increased childhood \\nmortality. Measles is especially common in emergencies and can trigger acute malnutrition and \\naggravate VAD to dangerous levels.\\nAcute malnutrition needs to be addressed in the emergency context both to support a child’s \\nright to sufficient food, growth and well-being and to prevent more serious illness and death \\n(138, 139, 152). From a cost perspective per child, moderate malnutrition is significantly cheaper \\nto treat than severe malnutrition. Additionally, in emergencies there is generally disruption of \\naccess to basic food needs, health services and water and sanitation, and the effects will be \\nfelt more quickly and may have a more deleterious impact on families affected by HIV and AIDS \\n(152). Emergencies can also provoke and aggravate cases of chronic or acute malnutrition and \\nmicronutrient deficiencies through the impact they have on psychosocial well-being ( 154). \\nIn emergency situations there is an increased risk of death among the affected population and \\nin particular among vulnerable groups, such as orphans, children and pregnant and lactating \\nwomen. Needs of these groups must be taken into consideration to undertake effective nutrition \\nprogramming. \\nActions for appropriate infant and young child feeding in emergencies ( 155)\\nEarly emergency response \\nThe infant feeding in emergencies (IFE) operational guidance gives full details on IFE \\nimplementation. In the first few days of an emergency, immediate links with other sectors should \\nbe established, such as with reproductive health to provide ‘safe havens’ for pregnant and \\nlactating women. These ‘safe havens’ should be easily-accessible areas where privacy, security \\nand shelter are provided with access to water and food. Basic supportive care of breastfeeding \\nmothers and their infants can be offered and peer-to-peer support nurtured. \\nMinimum level of response \\nA minimum response to support IFE is indicated in all emergencies. This should include \\nnutritional adequacy and suitability of the general food ration for older infants and young children; \\nconsideration of supplementary feeding of pregnant and lactating women; ensuring and easing \\naccess to basic water and sanitation facilities, cooking, food and non-food items; ensuring rest \\nareas for populations in transit, including private areas for breastfeeding if culturally indicated; and \\nestablishing timely registration of newborns to support early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding. \\nPreventing and controlling micronutrient deficiencies: Multiple vitamin  \\nand mineral supplements \\nThe groups most vulnerable to micronutrient deficiencies are pregnant women, lactating women \\nand young children, mainly because they have a relatively greater need for vitamins and minerals \\nand are more susceptible to the harmful consequences of deficiencies.\\nWhen fortified rations are not being given, children aged 6 to 59 months should be given one \\ndose each day of the micronutrient supplement shown in Table I-7; when fortified rations are \\nbeing given, children aged 6 to 59 months should be given two doses each week of the same \\nmicronutrient supplement.'),\n",

Vitamin A provides an essential part of \\nthe treatment protocol for children already infected with measles, and supplementation during \\nmass measles vaccination campaigns provides protection against further VAD and the severity of \\npotential measles infection (see section on vitamin A).\\nBreastfeeding and appropriate complementary feeding should also continue to be promoted \\nactively. The multiple micronutrient supplements should be given until the emergency is over and \\naccess to nutrient-rich foods is restored. \\nArtificial feeding in emergencies \\nAny support of artificial feeding in an emergency should be based on a needs assessment by \\nskilled technical staff, including a risk analysis.

Despite its proven \\nefficacy, supply and distribution of daily systems can be costly and logistically complicated. Lack \\nof supply of affordable supplements may limit the success of many supplementation programmes \\n(161, 162, 163). Another challenge is the occurrence of mild side effects, such as darkened \\nstools, gastrointestinal pain, diarrhoea, constipation and vomiting ( 69). \\nIntermittent supplementation, though not eliminating side effects, reduces their frequency and \\npossibly their severity compared to daily supplementation ( 68, 164, 165, 166, 167). Intermittent \\niron supplementation is the provision of iron supplements once, twice or three times a week \\non non-consecutive days ( 168). The rationale behind the intervention is that there is a limit to \\nthe iron absorption capacity of the intestine. Intermittent dosing may be as effective as daily \\nsupplementation because similar amounts of iron would reach the blood and tissues under both \\nstrategies (169, 170, 171). Intermittent supplementation has been shown to improve iron status \\nmore than no supplementation and, in many cases, it is as effective at improving iron status as \\ndaily supplementation (172, 173). \\nA Cochrane systematic review assessed the evidence behind the benefits and safety of \\nintermittent iron supplementation on anaemia and other health outcomes ( 168). The review \\ncompared the intermittent use of iron supplements alone, or in combination with folic acid or \\nother micronutrients, versus no intervention or placebo, and versus the same supplements given \\ndaily to women after menarche. The results showed that women who were taking intermittent iron \\nsupplements, alone or combined with other micronutrients, had higher haemoglobin and ferritin \\nconcentrations and were less likely to develop anaemia than those not receiving the supplement.'),\n",

At least half of this \\nanaemia burden is assumed to be due to iron deficiency (178), with the rest due to other conditions \\nsuch as folate, vitamin B12 or vitamin A deficiencies, chronic inflammation, parasitic infections \\nand inherited disorders. A pregnant woman is considered to be anaemic if her haemoglobin \\nconcentration during the first and third trimester of gestation is lower than 110 g/l, at sea level. \\nLow haemoglobin concentrations indicative of moderate or severe anaemia during pregnancy \\nhave been associated with an increased risk of premature delivery, maternal and child mortality, \\nand infectious diseases. Growth and development may also be affected, both in utero and in the \\nlong term. Conversely, haemoglobin concentrations greater than 130 g/l at sea level may also be \\nassociated with negative pregnancy outcomes such as premature delivery and low birth weight.\\nInterventions aimed at preventing iron deficiency and IDA in pregnancy include iron supplemen -\\ntation, fortification of staple foods with iron, health and nutrition education, control of parasitic \\ninfections, and improvements in sanitation. During pregnancy, women need to consume additional \\niron to ensure they have sufficient iron stores to prevent iron deficiency. Therefore, in most low- \\nand middle-income countries, iron supplements are used extensively by pregnant women to \\nprevent and correct iron deficiency and anaemia during gestation.\\nAn existing Cochrane systematic review assessing the benefits and harms of iron supplementation \\nin healthy pregnant women was updated to arrive at this recommendation ( 179).

Thus, there is an increased need for \\nvitamin A during pregnancy, although the additional amount required is small and the increased \\nrequirement is limited to the third trimester. The prevalence of night blindness (as a consequence \\nof VAD) is more common in the third trimester of pregnancy, and populations with a prevalence \\n≥5% are considered to have a significant public health problem. It is currently estimated that 9.8 \\nmillion pregnant women are affected by night blindness worldwide.\\nAccording to two Cochrane systematic reviews, assessing the effects and safety of vitamin A \\nsupplementation in pregnant women ( 186, 187), it reduced the risk of maternal night blindness \\n(one trial) and there was no difference in total fetal loss, rates of stillbirth and neonatal deaths \\nbetween women given vitamin A compared with controls. \\nAfter an analysis of currently available evidence, WHO published a guideline indicating that \\nvitamin A supplementation is not recommended during pregnancy as part of routine antenatal \\ncare for the prevention of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. The use of a supplement \\nis only recommended for the prevention of night blindness when there is a severe public health \\nproblem related to vitamin A, as indicted in the recommendation quoted above.\\nOther interventions such as dietary diversification and food fortification can be used along with \\nvitamin A supplementation to improve vitamin A intakes. Pregnant women should be encouraged \\nto receive adequate nutrition, which is best achieved through consumption of a healthy balanced \\ndiet.\\n4.4 Calcium supplements in pregnant women\\nWHO RECOMMENDATION\\nSupplementation of pregnant women with 1.5 to 2.0 grams of elemental calcium per day \\nis recommended in areas where dietary calcium intake is low and for women at high risk \\nof developing hypertensive disorders during pregnancy ( 188, 189).1 \\nThe recommended dose is of three tablets three times per day, preferably with meals, for \\nthe duration of the pregnancy to achieve daily intake of 1.5 grams of elemental calcium.\\nRationale and evidence\\nPre-eclampsia is a hypertensive disorder that develops in approximately 5% of all pregnancies, \\nusually after about 20 weeks gestation (190). In pre-eclampsia there are often problems with the \\nplacenta, along with increased blood pressure, that can reduce blood flow and therefore oxygen \\nand nutrient supply to the baby. These conditions may result in intra-uterine growth retardation \\nand possibly early delivery. Especially in lower-income settings, hypertensive disorders are the \\nleading cause of infant mortality ( 191). Pre-eclampsia may also cause serious outcomes for the \\nmother, such as kidney and liver problems, even progressing to stroke or seizures (eclampsia) \\nif not treated. Hypertensive disorders such as pre-eclampsia are thought to account for up to \\n40 000 maternal deaths per year. \\nMost women are monitored for increasing blood pressure during antenatal visits. Preventive \\nmeasures may assist in the prevention of prenatal complications and adverse outcomes for \\nwomen at increased risk of hypertensive disorders, such as those with multiple pregnancies, \\nolder age or increased BMI ( 192). Calcium supplements may reduce the chance of developing \\npre-eclampsia, especially in high-risk women, as well as those who do not consume sufficient \\n1 Women are regarded as being at high risk of developing hypertension and pre-eclampsia if they have one or \\nmore of the following risk factors: obesity, previous pre-eclampsia, diabetes, chronic hypertension, renal disease, \\nautoimmune disease, multiple pregnancy, and either adolescent or late pregnancy. This is not an exhaustive list, but \\ncan be adapted/complemented based on the local epidemiology of pre-eclampsia (see 189).'),\n",

Recent studies have supported this \\nhypothesis, although there have been some inconsistencies in the strength and public health \\napplications of the associations (198, 199). In addition, the possible biological actions of prenatal \\ncalcium supplementation are not completely understood. \\nCalcium is an essential mineral that assists with many of the body’s processes, such as maintaining \\ncell membranes in nerve as well as muscle contraction ( 200). Low calcium intake is thought to \\ncause high blood pressure by increasing the amount of calcium released in the cells of blood \\nvessels, possibly leading to the constriction of these tissues. By supplementing with calcium \\nduring pregnancy, the amount of cellular calcium released is lessened, as is smooth muscle \\ntissue contractility. These mechanisms could prevent preterm labour and delivery by reducing \\nuterine muscle contractions, and perhaps improving utero-placental blood flow ( 201). \\nDuring pregnancy and lactation calcium supplementation is often recommended to meet the \\nbody’s demands to benefit the overall health of mother and child. Dietary reference intakes \\nfor pregnant women range from 1000 to 1300 mg per day, according to age group, with an \\nupper limit set at 2500 mg/day ( 202). Although providing extra calcium supplements to prevent \\nhypertensive disorders is relatively inexpensive and accessible, large doses of > 500 mg/day are \\nless efficiently absorbed and may inhibit the absorption of other necessary micronutrients such \\nas iron, zinc, magnesium and phosphorus ( 203, 204). \\nAccording to a recent Cochrane systematic review, supplementation with at least 1 g of calcium \\nis associated with significantly lower risk of pregnant women developing pre-eclampsia and \\npreterm birth among women with low calcium intakes. However, the public health implications \\nfor this intervention are not completely clear. Another recent study determined that calcium \\nsupplementation in pregnant women with low calcium intakes may not necessarily benefit \\nmaternal bone health ( 205). Conflicting evidence exists on the benefits of maternal calcium \\nsupplementation on the blood pressure of their offspring ( 206, 207, 208). \\nIn summary, as indicated in the most recent WHO guidelines, there is clear evidence to show \\nthat daily supplementation with 1.5 to 2 g of elemental calcium is beneficial to reduce the risks of \\ngestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia and preterm birth ( 189).\\n4.5 Reaching optimal iodine nutrition in pregnant and lactating women \\nWHO RECOMMENDATION\\nWHO and UNICEF recommend iodine supplementation for pregnant and lactating women \\nin countries where less than 20% of households have access to iodized salt, until the salt \\niodization programme is scaled up. Countries with a household access to iodized salt \\nbetween 20% and 90% should make efforts to accelerate salt iodization or assess the \\nfeasibility of increasing iodine intake in the form of a supplement or iodine fortified foods \\nby the most susceptible groups (137).\\nTable I-12 shows the recommended daily or annual doses of iodine when \\nsupplementation is needed.\\nTable I-12 WHO-recommended dosages of daily and annual iodine supplementation\\nPopulation Group Daily dose of iodine supplement \\n(µg/day)\\nSingle annual dose of iodized oil \\nsupplement (mg/year)\\nPregnant women 250 400\\nLactating women 250 400\\nWomen of reproductive age \\n(15–49 years) 150 400'),\n",

This situation may jeopardize the optimal brain development of the fetus and young \\nchild. \\nIrrespective of where countries, or areas within countries, are categorized with regard to USI, \\nthere are specific situations, such as in emergencies, among displaced people and geographically \\nremote areas, where iodized salt may not be accessible. In these specific situations, increasing \\niodine intake should be provided in the form of iodine supplements for pregnant and lactating \\nwomen, and a supplement or complementary food fortified with iodine for children 6–23 months \\nof age. \\nIn cases where it is difficult to reach pregnant women, supplementation to all women of \\nreproductive age is advised.\\nActions to promote optimal iodine nutrition in pregnant and lactating women\\nThe actions summarized in the section on iodine in young children, pages 30–31, apply to \\npregnant and lactating women.\\n4.6 Nutrition care and support for pregnant women during emergencies1  \\n ( 152)\\nWHO RECOMMENDATION\\nSee page 36 for recommendation. \\nRationale and evidence\\nDuring pregnancy and lactation, women’s nutritional needs for energy, protein and micronutrients \\nsignificantly increase. Pregnant women require an additional 285 kcals/day, and lactating women \\nrequire an additional 500 kcals/day. Both pregnant and lactating women have increased needs \\nfor micronutrients. Adequate intake of iron, folate, vitamin A and iodine are particularly important \\nfor the health of both women and their infants. \\nIntra-household food distribution practices in many situations result in pregnant and lactating \\nwomen consuming less than their minimum requirements. The consequences of poor nutritional \\nstatus and inadequate nutritional intake for women during pregnancy and lactation not only directly \\naffect the women’s health status but may have a negative impact on infant birth weight and \\nearly development. Therefore, to meet the additional requirements of pregnancy and lactation, \\ncomplementary interventions may be undertaken in addition to the provision of a basic food ration.\\nAppropriate complementary actions to meet the additional needs of pregnant and \\nlactating women in emergencies ( 152) \\nFortified food commodities 2\\nFortified blended food commodities are designed to provide 10%–12% (up to 15%) of energy \\nfrom protein and 20%–25% energy from fat. The blended food must be fortified to meet two \\nthirds of daily requirements for all micronutrients, particularly iron, folic acid and vitamin A. The \\nfood commodities can be provided through maternal and child health structures (in conjunction \\nwith other health services) or through blanket supplementary feeding programmes.\\n1 The earlier section on infant and young child feeding in emergencies includes actions that also apply to pregnant \\nand lactating women, including the recommendation.\\n2 The food should be provided in addition to the basic general ration, either through the same mechanism as the \\ngeneral ration distribution or through maternal and child health facilities as a blanket supplementary feeding ration. \\nThe food should be targeted to women in their second and third trimesters of pregnancy and during the first six \\nmonths of the lactating period (i.e. for a total period of 12 months).'),\n",

For a pregnant woman \\nthese include a greater risk of dying during childbirth, or of giving birth to an underweight or \\nmentally-impaired baby. For a lactating mother, her micronutrient status determines the health and \\ndevelopment of her breastfed infant, especially during the first six months of life. \\nOne way to meet the recommended daily intake of micronutrients is to provide foods fortified \\nwith micronutrients. Fortified foods, such as corn-soya blend, biscuits, vegetable oil enriched \\nwith vitamin A and iodized salt, are usually provided as part of food rations during emergencies. \\nThe aim is to avert micronutrient deficiencies or prevent them from getting worse among the \\naffected population. Such foods must be appropriately fortified, taking into account the fact that \\nother unfortified foods will meet a share of micronutrient needs. However, foods fortified with \\nmicronutrients may not meet fully the needs of certain nutritionally vulnerable subgroups such as \\npregnant and lactating women.

The evolution of evidence for the \\neffects of nutrition interventions, \\n1960 –2010\\nSystematic scientific studies of the nature and causes of malnutrition in children and mothers \\nin low-income societies were brought into early focus by Scrimshaw and colleagues ( 1), based \\nlargely on work in Central America. A number of prospective studies, of which one of the most \\ninfluential was conducted in Narangwal, India ( 2), established that nutrition interventions were \\nefficacious in contributing to child health, survival, growth and development. The authors of a \\nsynthesis of ten such studies ( 3) concluded that health and nutrition interventions do have a \\npositive impact on children’s nutrition.\\nPrimary health care, as conceived at the Alma Ata conference (4), included nutrition interventions, \\nas did Child Survival programmes ( 5) and similar initiatives, as brought together at the World \\nSummit for Children ( 6). These interventions were bundled (e.g. UNICEF’s GOBI-FFF – growth \\nmonitoring, oral rehydration, breastfeeding, immunization, female education, family spacing and \\nfood supplements) and applied on a large scale, but evaluations of impact were scarce. The \\nevidence for designing effective programmes continued to be based primarily on the efficacy of \\nindividual interventions in experimental conditions. 1 A few large-scale programmes which started \\nin the 1980s, such as the Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Programme (TINP) supported by the \\nWorld Bank, and the Iringa Joint Nutrition Support Programme (JNSP), supported by UNICEF \\nand WHO, were carefully monitored, and the evidence continues to be relevant.\\nA considerable variety of interventions have been regarded as part of nutrition programmes (and \\nmany are also included in health-related programmes, such as the Integrated Management of \\nChildhood Illness – IMCI ( 7)). The content ranged from feeding programmes and behavioural \\nchange, to immunization and medical interventions. The scope of this review was set by \\nconsiderations of efficacy studies, and experience of programmes either defined as strictly \\nnutrition, or with substantial nutrition components or objectives. For example, the Lancet \\nnutrition series ( 8) evaluated 20 separately-defined interventions. As described in  Part I of \\nthis document, an independent but similar set of ENAs may be grouped as addressing general \\nnutrition, micronutrients and disease control. The main routes or platforms for interventions \\ntargeting mothers and young children are community based, usually linked to health facilities \\n(or government outreach activities), and/or campaigns such as child health days/weeks. Cash \\ntransfer programmes, conditional or unconditional (CCTs or CTs) have recently increased in \\ncoverage and importance in addressing health and nutrition problems; usually they constitute \\nprogrammes (or platforms) themselves, with conditionality linked to health, nutrition and education \\n(see later section).\\nEvidence for the impact of nutrition actions from experimental studies (i.e. efficacy trials) has \\nshown that child (and less often maternal) nutritional status can benefit from direct interventions \\n(9, 10, 11 ). However, scaling-up based on efficacy results requires caution, as operational \\nprogrammes have different conditions than efficacy trials, and priority should be given to evaluating \\neffectiveness under operational conditions. This approach requires alternative, rigorous methods, \\nbeyond randomized trials (12), that have so far rarely been applied and carried through.\\nWhile a number of large-scale programmes were undertaken starting in the 1970s (see Table \\nII-1), only a few included impact evaluation. Programme development continued without a solid \\nevidence base, both as large-scale investments from the World Bank (e.g. in Bangladesh, \\nMadagascar and Senegal), and as development of national programmes (e.g. in Thailand and \\nVietnam). The Thailand programme was developed after rejecting conventional externally-driven \\n1 Effectiveness refers to estimated changes in outcome (e.g. child nutritional status) in large-scale operational \\nprogrammes; and efficacy to changes in outcome estimated to be attributable to the intervention under controlled \\nconditions.'),\n",

(This programme is discussed later.) \\nEvaluations and assessments of operational programmes gradually built up from findings from \\nlarge-scale programmes as they expanded from the 1980s on. Based on this development, \\nsome 61 projects, mostly large scale, have been reviewed (see Table II-1), representing most \\nof the programmes considered relevant over about the last 30 years. Some of the early projects, \\nsuch as the Narangwal study, tended towards efficacy trials, and they provide a basis for later \\nwork. Reviews by Gwatkin and colleagues ( 3) and Berg ( 15) drew on the same projects, and \\nwere significant in catalysing the expansion of large-scale programmes starting in the 1980s \\n(16). Eleven commissioned country case studies provided additional information ( 17). A regional \\nplanning project sponsored by the Asian Development Bank and UNICEF assessed programmes \\nin seven Asian countries ( 18, 19 ). An assessment of nutritional trends associated with nine \\nprogrammes (20) was carried out as part of the Combating malnutrition: time to act study  (21), \\nwhich included four in-depth country investigations. The review was extended to include estimates \\nof resources (intensity, as resources/head per year), coverage, outcomes and other key factors, \\nfor 15 programmes (22). A World Bank report ( 23), quoting many of the projects listed in Table \\nII-1, referred to “short routes to improving nutrition”, meaning direct interventions as opposed to \\nchanging context (e.g. education, income).\\nThe Lancet nutrition series ( 11) contains many of the efficacy results reported in Part I, as well \\nas drawing on a number of the same set of established large-scale projects in Table II-1 (24). \\nNonetheless, the paucity of rigorous effectiveness evaluations of large-scale programmes was \\nhighlighted by the comprehensive Lancet exercise. The World Bank sponsored re-evaluation \\nin at least two cases – for Bangladesh ( 25) and Madagascar ( 26), as well as an evaluation of \\ntheir Senegal programme ( 27). The Independent Evaluation Group published a synthesis of 28 \\nevaluations (some large-scale, some experimental) ( 28). This review failed to elicit a clear pattern \\nof activities linked to impact. However, it did not include estimates of intensity of resource use, \\nwhich is likely to account for some differences. It acknowledged the likely impact of a number \\nof the programmes reviewed, and where feasible estimated effect sizes. (This relation between \\ninput levels – ‘intensity’ – and size of effect has been rarely examined until recently.)\\nSeveral external agencies, such as the World Bank, the United States Agency for International \\nDevelopment, the Swedish International Development Agency and UNICEF supported these \\nprogrammes. The reviews that synthesized these experiences ( Table II-1 ) relied mainly on \\nimplementation and management aspects, since few evaluation data were available.'),\n",

What do we need to know? \\nThe actual impact in large-scale operational, multi-component programmes depends not just \\non the efficacy (hence, potential impact) of individual interventions, e.g. counselling on feeding \\npractices. It also depends on the means by which these are provided (platforms or routes), the \\nresource use, the context, and the interactions with other activities and factors. Without these it \\nis difficult to interpret diverse results, as noted above ( 28). Not just interventions, but the routes \\nby which people participate need consideration.\\nThe evidence from large-scale programmes should be combined with efficacy to reach \\ngeneralizable conclusions concerning the evidence and its interpretation, as well as its application \\nto possible designs and resourcing of strengthened, scaled-up or new programmes intended to \\naccelerate improvement of nutrition in children and women in low- and middle-income countries. \\nDirect estimation of impact from some form of randomized assignment to treatment groups has \\nvirtually never proved feasible in national or large-scale programmes. Estimates of effectiveness \\nat this scale depend on evaluation designs that attempt to extract likely net change attributable \\nto an intervention by a variety of methods, often described as quasi-experimental (including \\nnatural experiments). Probably the only near-national programme that deliberately assigned the \\npopulation to treatment or comparison groups was the Progresa/Oportunidades  programme in \\nMexico (29).\\nThe development over time of large-scale maternal and child nutrition programmes (e.g. as \\nmeasured by growth or BMI) was significantly interrupted by a move towards micronutrient \\nprogrammes, which were largely run outside mainstream maternal and child activities. For \\ninstance, iodized salt was usually a separate programme, and VAD was mainly addressed \\nthrough intermittent high dose capsule distribution in child health campaigns and/or immunization \\nactivities. Iron supplementation was linked to regular programmes, but generally has not achieved \\nmuch outreach or impact. In the last decade, priorities have moved towards a more balanced and \\nintegrated approach. However, the data available on large-scale programmes cannot distinguish \\npossible effects of different components on general nutrition (measured by anthropometry), \\nalthough in principle micronutrient effects could be estimated when there are data (e.g. for \\nanaemia).\\nProgrammes should not be seen as simply an additive combination of single components (or \\nseparate interventions). Very often, multiple interventions can be expected to modify each other’s \\neffects.1 Resources may not be additive: once a system is working, the mix of interventions can be \\nflexible, and the marginal costs of adding activities lowered (within reason, without overwhelming \\nthe front-line worker). Key questions – of resource intensity and programme quality, coverage, \\ncontext, and platforms or routes by which individuals are in contact with overall combined \\nprogramme activities – are only recently being estimated as crucial determinants of outcome (22, \\n23, 24). This part of the document aims to stress the effectiveness of multi-component, large-\\nscale, operational programmes, and to be useful for decisions on policies and programmes; in \\nfact, the evaluation results appear adequate to contribute to such decisions (see Habicht and \\ncolleagues (30) on matching evaluation designs to decision needs).\\n1 These interactions can be either direction: as examples, controlling diarrhoea would be expected to make feeding \\nprogrammes more effective; measles immunization would lead to vitamin A supplements having less impact on \\nmeasles mortality.'),\n",

The impact on whom is being \\nestimated? \\nThe aim of this work is to provide evidence for attribution of changes in nutritional outcomes to \\nprogramme activities. For this, it is necessary to define precisely whose nutritional outcome is \\nbeing assessed, that is, whether the outcome refers to the participants or to the overall population \\n(by age, sex, etc.). The initial rate of improvement appears to be much faster than the sustained \\nrate, and this initial rate needs to be distinguished from the sustained rate to see consistent \\nresults. Typically the initial rate is about 5–10 percentage points change in underweight (ppt)/\\nyear, over a limited period (probably several months), and the sustained rate is then 1–2 ppt/year. \\nA typical underlying (no programme) improving trend is around -0.5 ppt/year (e.g. starting at \\n40%, reducing to 35% in a decade).\\nFour rates may be measured:\\n(1) Participants’ initial rate (usually obtained from weighing data);\\n(2) Participants’ sustained rate;\\n(3) Population initial rate;1\\n(4) Population sustained rate (e.g. from population-based evaluation surveys; related to \\nparticipants’ rate by coverage, although participants may change, coming in and out of the \\nprogramme). This is the indicator used in Figures II-1 and II-2, discussed later.\\nThe effect size can be measured as rates of change – e.g. ppt/year – or as before-after (one \\ntime) changes. Rate is used for programmes which are not usually intended to have a one-time \\nimpact but to keep going until the intended outcome reaches a norm or goal. 2 Efficacy results \\nusually refer to particular groups of participants (e.g. during pregnancy; 12–24 months old), and \\nare not always translated into expected effects in terms of population prevalence reductions (i.e. \\nrates of improvement in the population). Victora and colleagues ( 12) have discussed in detail the \\ndifferences expected between efficacy rates and those from routine programmes. The Lancet \\nseries reported simulations for coverages, giving the outputs as mortality, stunting and disability-\\nadjusted life years ( 11). Rates are used as the outcome for effectiveness, and effect sizes given \\nas ppt/year. \\n1 Usually not reported – population-based surveys are seldom carried out early in programmes.\\n2 Objectives are often stated as, for example, reducing underweight in preschool children by 25% over five years. \\nNote that this translates into ppt/year using the starting prevalence; if this is (say) 40%, then the objective is to \\nreach 30% in 5 years, which is 10/5 ppt/year, = 2 ppt/year.'),\n",

Shape of response curve\\nTwo important non-linear effects should be distinguished. First, the observation noted above \\nthat the initial rate of reduction in malnutrition among participants, soon after the programme is \\nlaunched, tends to be much more rapid than the sustained rate; thus, the prevalence curve is \\nsteep and then flattens. The reasons are not well established, but it seems likely that a vulnerable \\npart of the population – for example, those currently ill – may respond quickly to care and \\nmedical attention, and improve rapidly. The causes of current underweight may be different for \\nother segments of the population – for example, feeding practices or food insecurity – and they \\nmay improve less rapidly. It is the sustained rate that will eventually bring long-term nutrition \\nimprovement. What happens to the initial improvement if the programme is discontinued is not \\nknown, but it seems likely that it would deteriorate again. The estimated sustained rate at the \\npopulation level is used as the main indicator.\\nSecond, a non-linear dose-response type of relation between improvement rates (among \\nparticipants) and resources applied is expected. This has long been postulated ( 31), and a rule \\nsuggested that US$ 5–US$ 10/head per year is needed to bring an additional 1–2 ppt/year \\nimprovement in underweight (17). Below this a less-than-proportional effect is seen – a threshold \\nlevel must be reached before improvement starts. (A corollary is that spending too little per \\nparticipant does not just solve the problem more slowly, but does not solve it at all, and wastes \\nresources.) Until now not enough data have been available to examine this empirically. However, \\ncommunity health/nutrition worker (CHNW) numbers (e.g. CHNWs per 1000 households) give \\na useful measure of intensity and allow estimation of what resources are needed to achieve an \\neffect.\\nIn sum, one aim is to assess what types of operational programmes – multi-component, through \\ndifferent platforms – bring about a sustained reduction in child underweight among participants, \\nand what level of resources is needed. Of the 60-plus country programmes identified (see Table \\nII-1), 21 are reviewed here, and data were extracted from 11 that appeared to give reasonable \\nestimates of both nutrition improvements and resource uses, as shown in Figures II-1 and II-2.'),\n",

Which components via what \\nroutes/platforms are included in \\neffective programmes?\\nThe programme components considered are summarized in Table II-2, which shows the groupings \\nfor the effectiveness of large-scale programmes reviewed, and their equivalent headings as ENAs \\nwhose efficacy has been reviewed in Part I; and in turn in the Lancet nutrition series. \\nFor most programmes supplementary feeding refers to children, though occasionally may include \\nwomen (e.g. in Ethiopia and Mexico). Counselling is considered to be community-based, rather \\nthan promotion via media. Growth monitoring is included as an operational programme component, \\nbut by itself has no efficacy. Micronutrient supplementation does not include fortification, since \\nthe latter is usually provided by routes other than those described here. Almost all the available \\nprogramme outcome data are on general nutrition (of children), measured by anthropometry.\\nProgramme components were delivered by one or more of four routes shown in Table II-3 . \\nCommunity nutrition centres were the main route, usually as a base for CHNWs who may carry \\nout home visits. The distribution of routes was similar between the 32 programmes in total (Table \\nII-3a), the 21 programmes which were described in detail (Table II-3b), and the 11 programmes \\nfor which quantitative data were available ( Table II-3c). At least 70% of the programmes were \\ncommunity based, with CHNWs operating from a local nutrition centre.  Tables II-3a , II-3b, \\nand II-3c indicate that those analysed quantitatively ( Table II-3c ), selected because of data \\navailability, were not substantially different from the larger groups from which they were drawn. \\nThe 32 programmes in Table II-1 were identified from a literature search for information on \\nprogramme activities or components. Regardless of platform, all programmes reviewed were \\nmulti-component. Of the 32 programmes, 60% or more implemented supplementary feeding \\n(usually targeted), growth monitoring and counselling (support for breastfeeding, complementary \\nfeeding or pregnancy, alone or in combination) (see Table II-4a ); 80% or more of the 21 \\nprogrammes described in detail implemented these components ( Table II-4b). All programmes \\nfor which quantitative data were available included the three components ( Table II-4c ), with \\ncounselling as the intervention most frequently provided.

Estimating nutrition  \\nimprovement achieved and \\nassociated resources\\n6.1 Data sources and calculations\\nAs indicated previously, about 60 programmes, mostly large-scale, were identified, almost all \\nfrom previous reviews as listed in Table II-1. Of these, 21 were reviewed in detail, and for 11 \\nprogrammes, sufficient data on both outcome (underweight,1 ppt/year) and intensity of resources \\n(CHNWs per 1000 households, 2 and US$/household per year) were identified and further \\nreviewed to explore associations. Initial identification of these programmes was by country; within \\ncountries, data on individual programmes were then investigated further. For each country and \\nprogramme, the estimates for reduction in underweight and resource intensity were made from \\navailable materials.\\nThe intensity estimates were determined from project documents, reports, etc. (for further details, \\nsee Annex 3). CHNWs were classified as full or part-time. Based on informal enquiries (e.g. in \\nThailand), it was estimated that part-time CHNWs worked about one half-day per week, so that \\none full-time CHNW would be equivalent to ten part-time ones, except where indicated. The \\nfinances assigned to the programmes were taken from budget or expenditure reports, and are \\nvery approximate. They were divided by the child population covered to give US$/child per year. \\nThe figures are intended to estimate running costs, but in some cases part of start-up costs was \\nincluded. The sources of the results used are described below.\\nBangladesh. The Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Project (BINP) operated from 1995 to 2002 \\nwith approximate coverage by area of 15% (59/464 thanas). Intensity of CHNWs was reported \\nas 1:200 children ( 19), i.e. about 5:1000 households. Resource intensity was estimated at \\napproximately US$ 18/household per year, including supplementary feeding.\\nVarious evaluations of BINP’s nutritional impact were conducted by both internal and external \\nreviewers. The estimate used of BINP impact on child underweight 3 was derived from a theory-\\nbased impact evaluation of the project in which a combination of data from previous evaluations \\nwas used (33, 34). This latter evaluation reported an overall 2.0 ppt reduction in underweight due \\nto BINP activities, i.e. 0.3 ppt/yr. \\nSubsequent activities led into the National Nutrition Programme (NNP), 2004–2007, whose \\nintended coverage was 105/464 thanas. This programme had implementation problems; the \\nbaseline survey was delayed and the end survey never conducted ( 35). Thus, no estimate of \\neffect is available.\\nSupport for nutrition activities became absorbed into the Health and Nutrition Population Sector \\nProgramme (HNPSP), 2007–2010 (25% nutrition and food security; about US$ 4 300 m in \\nfunding, 37% external). HNPSP has no available evaluation data, and disbursement (as of July \\n2010) was about 5%, so was clearly slow in starting ( 35).\\nEthiopia. The Community Based Nutrition Programme (CBN), as part of the National Nutrition \\nProgramme, was initiated in 2008 and continues today ( 36). Population coverage in target \\nareas (now approximately 250/640 woredas (districts)) is approximately 40% and intensity of \\nCHWs is about 1:23 children, estimated as 0.2 FTEs, i.e. 86:1000 households (37). Estimates of \\nreduction in underweight from the CBN programme are preliminary, derived from an initial analysis \\n1 As far as possible, the age group for which these estimates were made was 0–5 years; no adjustment was made if \\nonly other age groups were reported (e.g. 0–3 years).\\n2 While most CHNWs are part-time, in some projects full-time CHNWs are hired. Part-time CHNWs were calculated \\nas 0.1 full-time equivalents (FTEs).\\n3 Early estimates of initial reduction in underweight among participants were rapid, for severe malnutrition 13.8% \\nto 2.9% from April to November 1997 ( 32). UNICEF unpublished figures showed underweight in participants \\nchanged from 79% to 66% from April 1997 to March 1998 ( 20, Figure 2e.)'),\n",

Implications\\n7.1 Implications for programmes: limitations and caveats\\nThe role of individual interventions in improving child nutrition was discussed in Part I  of this \\ndocument. Efficacy in terms of, for example, counselling changing breastfeeding practices, is \\nwell understood. The impact of these changes on child health and development outcomes, while \\ncovered in fewer studies, is reasonably well established. Bhutta and colleagues ( 11) provide \\nan important synthesis as shown in Table II-2 . The issue addressed concerns the evidence \\nthat interventions, known to be efficacious individually, have an impact when incorporated into \\noperational large-scale programmes. \\nThe extended list of programmes in Table II-1 covers those that have been used for overviews in \\nthe past (up to 2010), with some newer ones identified and introduced for this review. Material \\nwas sought that described their content, with particular focus on quantitative measures of \\noutcome and of programme coverage and resources. Some characteristics of 32 programmes \\nwere extracted, and detailed case studies developed for 21 of these based on availability of \\ninformation (see Annex 3). Outcome evaluation data and resource estimates were considered \\nadequate for 11 of these (see Tables II-3 and II-4). The resource indicators chosen were (a) \\nCHNWs per 1000 participants (or CHNWs/1000 households) and (b) running expenditures as \\nUS$/household per year. The commonest outcome, underweight prevalence in children, was \\nestimated as a rate of change, as ppt/year. Assessing outcomes should distinguish initial rates \\nof improvement – now seen to be quite rapid – from the sustained rates (after a year or so); \\nand between programme participants and the overall child population. (These distinctions are \\nnot always made in reports.) The population sustained rate of improvement was estimated in \\ncomparing outcomes.\\nThe limited quality and number of the evaluation results for effectiveness of operational nutrition \\nprogrammes is widely recognized to be a major constraint. The approach to evaluation of operational \\nprogrammes is necessarily quite different to efficacy trials ( 12) and can rarely use randomization \\nto treatment and comparison groups. Other designs can be employed, and especially when \\nthese are prospective, can give plausible inferences on impact, usually requiring some advanced \\nanalyses. As Bhutta and colleagues ( 11) noted from their extensive literature search for meta-\\nanalyses, ”(of) evidence from effectiveness trials and programme assessments, fewer than 3% of \\nall interventions qualified” for inclusion. Virtually all their data were from trials, and the results refer \\nto efficacy. The quality of evidence on effectiveness is weaker, and permits including a number of \\nthe programmes excluded by Bhutta and colleagues. However, as described above, a number of \\nprogrammes have been evaluated (some re-evaluated, e.g. by the World Bank, from Bangladesh, \\nMadagascar and Senegal), and extracting the best estimates where data are available seems to \\ngive at least a plausible pattern, e.g. as shown in Figure II-1. Details of how the numbers were \\nobtained are given in the text above and in the case studies in Annex 3.\\nPrevious syntheses of evaluation results – including on efficacy – have not emphasized the key \\nfactors of coverage and resource intensity. Differences in resources (per capita) would be likely \\nto influence impact, and would account for part of the differences between impact observed \\nin large-scale programmes versus trials and pilot projects (where resources are normally less \\nconstrained). Thus particular attention has been paid to relating outcomes to resources. The \\nindicators that could be obtained, e.g. CHNWs/1000, do not reflect quality, training, incentives, \\nsupervision and other crucial factors which should be included in future studies. CHNWs/1000 \\nmay also be an available proxy indicator of broader programme effort.\\nThe programmes considered operate through CHNWs, based usually in community centres (with \\nhome visiting); the distribution of platforms is shown in Table II-3. Supervision is usually through \\nthe health system. The programmes have a reasonably common overall pattern of activities – \\ncounselling, micronutrients, etc. – but within these details vary, presumably with different \\nconditions and contexts.

The outcome used, underweight, may not be affected by the \\nmicronutrient components. The relation between programmes with common but not standardized \\nfeatures and a general nutrition outcome can be examined. The relative effects of individual \\ncomponents cannot be assessed in the present data.\\n7.2 Specific implications for designing future programmes  \\n and sustaining existing ones\\nWhen assessed in successful programmes, it appears that the initial improvement in underweight \\nprevalence in participants is quite rapid, reducing by up to 10 ppt in the first year or so. At the \\nsame time, severe malnutrition also falls rapidly to low levels (e.g. 10% to 2%). This pattern was \\nseen in, for example, Bangladesh (early BNIP), Ethiopia, Senegal, Tanzania (Iringa), Thailand and \\nother places. The reasons for this initial response are not known, and are likely to be in part from \\ntreatment of diseases and immunization.\\nThe sustained rate, over a number of years, is what presumably makes a long-term difference. \\nAn expected dose-response is seen roughly in the sustained rate ( Figure II-1), measuring the \\nresources as CHNWs/1000 households (or children). The results suggest that a level of around \\n30 CHNWs/1000 (1 CHNW:33 children, estimated as part time, 0.1 FTEs) is needed for an \\nimprovement rate of 1 ppt/year or higher in underweight.\\nThe most important implication is that community-based nutrition programmes can be effective, \\nand that adequate resources – for example, enough CHNWs, trained and supported – must \\nbe put into these, and sustained over years, for them to provide a substantial impact on child \\nnutrition. For example, a with-programme improvement rate of 1.5 ppt/year is typical; current sub-\\nregional child underweight prevalences are 13%–23% in Africa, with change rates of 0.1 to -0.2 \\nppt/year; in Asia these figures are 18%–33%, with change rates of -0.3 to -1.0 ppt/year. A rate \\nof 1.5 ppt/year over 10 years reduces these prevalences by 15 ppt, i.e. to 0%–7% in Africa and \\n3%–18% in Asia (57). Thus, sustaining these activities at the required intensity for 10 years or so \\nwould substantially reduce child malnutrition, as has been seen in several countries with national \\nprogrammes (e.g. Thailand, Vietnam). 2\\nThe resources needed show no such relation ( Figure II-2 ), partly because of difficulties in \\nestimating financial resources. This finding may also reflect that it is how funds are used that \\ncounts: investing in local organizations, and especially appropriate training, support, and \\nincentives for community workers, are key.\\nThe precise details of the interventions (counselling, referral, micronutrients, etc.) may not be the \\nmost essential factor, although of course they must be relevant and appropriate to the context. \\nThe extent of contact between trained, familiar community workers and mothers with children \\nmay be more crucial. It could be argued that the impact comes not primarily from delivering \\nservices, but from fostering the collective efficacy of communities: mothers obtain more control \\nover their families’ health and survival, and increase their own effective efforts. 3 This is catalysed \\nand supported by the community-based programme structure.\\nThe question of interfacing with vertical programmes – child health days or weeks – was not \\nexplicitly studied here. Experience in six African countries ( 58, 59 ) indicates that there are \\nopportunity costs to child health days/weeks for community-based programmes (e.g. personnel \\n1 “Complementary foods” refers to those given from six months on to complement breastfeeding; it may in practice \\nrefer to children’s foods in the period between 6 and 23 months of age. Supplementary foods refer here to foods \\nprovided from outside of the household.\\n2 Countries that have experienced transitions at these rates are illustrated in ( 57), Figure 9 – some of which may be \\nattributable to nutrition programmes (but the data are insufficient to estimate how much).\\n3 This argument is elaborated on p. 1067 in ( 22). The huge commitments of their own scarce resources that poor \\nfamilies make to children’s education attest to the strong will to foster children’s welfare, when people know better \\nhow to do so.'),\n",

Cash Transfer Programmes\\nCash transfer programmes, conditional (on health/nutrition related actions: CCTs) or unconditional \\n(CTs) have expanded rapidly in recent years, and are of increasing importance for improving \\nnutrition. They are highly complementary to other nutrition actions, and involve establishing \\neligibility, usually based on low income. Hence, they are positively targeted towards the poor and \\nmost vulnerable. The level of resources/head is much higher than for typical nutrition programmes \\n– but the objectives are broader – and the scale in terms of coverage equal or higher. Their effect \\non nutrition is both through increasing resources (income), and, for conditional programmes, \\nenhancing use of services such as immunization and education. The impact on nutritional status \\nof children is potentially both through maternal nutrition and hence intra-uterine growth and \\ndevelopment, and through infant and young child feeding, care, and use of health services. \\nExamples of CCTs and CTs that have been described and evaluated to some extent were drawn \\nfrom the literature, agency reports, and other documents for this section. These sixteen case \\nstudies are described in Annex 3, and some characteristics summarized in Table II-5. CCTs are \\nthe usual form for these programmes in Latin America, where they have been operating for some \\ntime, while CTs are the norm in Africa.\\nCash transfer programmes provide assistance in the form of money in order to increase household \\nincome. Transfers may be given without requirements that household members meet specified \\nconditions, or be contingent upon compliance with a specified set of conditions. CCTs have \\nincreased in popularity in recent years due to their perceived ability to create long-term benefits \\nthrough encouraging behaviour adoption that improves well-being, and investing in human capital \\n(62). Provision of transfer is generally targeted to poor households. Programmes may directly \\naffect nutrition (e.g. providing supplements), or connect to nutrition outcomes less directly (e.g. \\nthrough increasing use of health services, antenatal care or education). Conditionalities may \\ninclude periodic health visits, growth monitoring, vaccination when applicable, antenatal care, \\nand attendance at education sessions by mothers ( 63).\\nBoth CTs and CCTs are forms of social assistance, or safety nets, assisting beneficiaries who are \\nvulnerable to impoverishment without support ( 62, 64 ). Public works programmes (productive \\nsafety nets) and in-kind transfers (food for work) are two other components of social safety nets \\nbut will not be described in detail here. Ethiopia’s PSNP is included as cash transfers are provided \\nto mothers. In sub-Saharan Africa overall approximately 137 programmes were in operation in \\n37 countries in 2009 ( 64). Transfer programmes in Latin American countries are mostly CCTs, \\nwhich have dramatically increased in popularity in comparison to CTs, as well as expanded to \\nother regions, in the past 10 years ( 63).\\nSeveral programmes, such as Oportunidades in Mexico, Bolsa Familia  in Brazil, and Red \\nde Protección Social  in Nicaragua include requirements for receipt of transfers specific to \\naddressing nutritional concerns. Conditions intended to improve nutritional outcomes may \\naddress behaviours through group nutrition education sessions and growth monitoring and \\npromotion, which also may be accompanied by more personalized counselling. Conditionalities \\naimed at improving micronutrient status may be employed in CCT programmes through provision \\nof essential micronutrients and food or supplements to supply both macro- and micronutrients, \\nthough the latter has been limited to Mexico’s Progresa (65). \\nConditionalities in programmes with nutrition objectives may be determined based on country \\ncontext and nutrition actions for which there is evidence of efficacy. CCTs that are intended \\nto improve nutritional outcomes should be “well coordinated with the existing priorities guiding \\na country’s nutrition policy” ( 65). General agreement exists as to which interventions are the \\nmost efficacious, therefore guiding conditional requirements in CCT programmes. The efficacy \\nof these ENAs are described in Part I of this document and include: exclusive breastfeeding \\nfor six months, appropriate complementary feeding, appropriate nutritional care of sick and \\nseverely malnourished children, adequate intake of vitamin A and iron for women and children \\nand adequate intake of iodine by all household members ( 65 from 66).'),\n",

CCTs offer greater flexibility for determination of household needs and decreased \\nlogistical costs relative to in-kind transfers. In comparison to unconditional transfer programmes \\nCCTs are promoted as a direct investment in human capital, as well as an incentive for households \\nto adopt behaviours that improve well-being, both offering long-term benefits ( 62). \\nVarious mechanisms by which CCT programmes work to improve maternal and child nutrition \\nhave been proposed:\\n■■ As women typically receive the cash transfer, programme beneficiaries may be empowered \\nto prioritize care for both themselves and their children during the CCT programme and even \\nafter it ends (65).\\n■■ An increase in household purchasing power for food and health services may result from \\nCCT programmes ( 65). Due to the multifactoral nature of undernutrition, complementary \\ninterventions need to be supplied and maintained in addition to income provision for real \\nimprovement (67). \\n■■ Direct provision of micronutrients and/or energy supplements may be provided to mothers \\nand children, though this practice has not been widespread in CCT programmes thus far (65).\\n■■ Conditionalities such as growth monitoring for children, antenatal care for mothers, and \\nparticipation in nutrition education sessions for both may improve maternal and child nutrition \\nby addressing behavioural determinants of undernutrition ( 65).\\nAn important consideration of the ability of CCTs to improve nutritional status involves determining \\nthe effects of providing both demand- and supply-side incentives. Transfers offered to families \\ncan increase demand for health and nutrition services by overcoming barriers to access such as \\ndirect costs, indirect costs (transport, food during hospitalization) and opportunity costs (loss of \\nincome due to health-seeking activities). CCTs aimed at increasing demand for preventive services \\nmay also have positive spillover effects, thus furthering long-term benefits for beneficiaries ( 62). \\nInadequate or poor quality supply of services limits the effectiveness of demand-side CCTs. \\nTherefore some programmes are implementing supply-side transfers in addition to those typically \\nprovided directly to beneficiaries. For example, the Programa de Asignación Familiar  (PRAF) \\nprovides health centres with approximately US$ 6000 annually for meeting quality improvement \\nand service standards at rural health posts, including nutrition training for mothers ( 68). \\n8.2 Coverage and resource intensities\\nIn CCT programmes providing both demand and supply-side incentives the effects on health and \\nnutritional outcomes of each as well as the combination should be distinguished. For example, an \\nevaluation of Honduras’s PRAF demonstrated that demand-side transfers resulted in the largest \\nppt increase in healthcare visits among children under three years of age, as well as attendance \\nat growth monitoring within the same age group as compared to controls. The combination of \\ndemand- and supply-side benefits increased utilization of both health visits and growth monitoring \\nto a lesser extent, but supply-side incentives alone failed to increase utilization of either. The \\ndemand- and supply-side benefits individually and in combination resulted in improvements in \\nantenatal care attendance (five or more sessions), although supply-side incentives resulted in the \\nlowest percentage point increase (65). This example may be flawed since health facilities received \\nslightly more than one half of their expected incentives, but it is reasonable to assume that supply-\\nside incentives may be beneficial only when demand-side transfers are offered concurrently. \\nCash transfer programmes vary in implementation stage as pilots, early or small-scale programmes \\nor national coverage (see Table II-5 and details in Annex 1). Among pilot and early or small-scale \\nprogrammes, mostly CTs in sub-Saharan Africa and CCTs in Latin America, coverage ranges \\nfrom approximately 4000 beneficiaries, as in Zambia’s Kalomo Pilot Social Cash Transfer Scheme \\n(69) to 165 000 beneficiaries in Nicaragua’s RPS ( 70). This coverage represents less than 1% \\nand 3% of the populations respectively. Large-scale CCT programmes, mostly in operation in'),\n",

However, impacts on \\nchild growth, birth weight, as well as on food expenditure and consumption have been estimated \\n(see Annex 2, last column).\\nMexico’s Oportunidades has multiple evaluations reporting an approximate 1.0 cm increase in \\nheight among children ages 0–6 months and 12–36 months, all as compared to controls ( 62). \\nImprovement in HAZ scores as compared to controls of 0.13 (Brazil’s BF, children less than 7 \\nyears of age), 0.25 (South Africa’s CSG, children less than 36 months), 0.161 (Colombia’s FA, \\nchildren less than 24 months), and 0.17 (Nicaragua’s RPS, children less than 5 years) were \\nreported (62, 72).\\nIncrease in birth weight of 0.13 kg was reported among beneficiaries as compared to controls \\nin Mexico’s Oportunidades (74). Additionally, an increase of 0.58 kg in “newborn” weight was \\nreported for beneficiaries in Colombia’s FA, although this should be interpreted with caution since \\nthe programme was targeted to children rather than mothers. Although mixed results have been \\nfound, there is evidence that CCT programmes can have a positive impact on child nutritional \\nstatus. To date most CCT programmes designed to improve nutritional and health outcomes have \\ntargeted children rather than mothers, resulting in a lack of data available on changes in maternal \\nnutritional status (65).\\n8.4 Linkage to direct nutrition programmes\\nBoth types of cash transfer programmes offer a link to existing nutrition programmes within a \\ncountry. Furthermore, they may work to bolster both demand- and supply-side improvements in \\nnutrition services at the community level. When considering implementation of a cash transfer \\nprogramme designed to improve undernutrition, several rules for determining appropriateness \\nof using nutrition-related conditionalities have been proposed. An unconditional CT programme \\nshould be used when nutrition programmes of good quality are in place and utilized extensively. \\nIn contrast, a CCT programme is more useful when current nutrition programmes are not well-\\nutilized, but quality is good. CCTs in addition to supply-side incentives should be considered \\nwhen both quality and utilization of nutrition programmes is poor. Finally, when a country does not \\nhave an existing nutrition programme a CCT should be considered only when both services of \\nappropriate quality can be introduced and when beneficiaries are able to utilize the services (65). \\nA number of important factors are likely to affect the positive impact of CCTs on maternal and \\nchild nutrition outcomes. Programmes should focus on the window of opportunity for nutrition \\nimpact, pregnancy through two years of age, and therefore target beneficiaries in this range. \\nConditionalities should be specific to nutrition, based on best practices, including ENAs, for \\nwhich there is evidence of efficacy. Supply-side transfers should be provided when needed in \\norder to maintain quality and quantity of health and nutrition services, thus increasing the ability \\nof CCTs to improve the nutritional status of mothers and children.'),\n",

This led into the National Nutrition Program, 2004–\\n2007, whose intended coverage was 105/464 thanas. Both of these programmes were \\nsupported by the World Bank. Various issues inhibited activities, which appear to have been \\nabsorbed into the Health and Nutrition Population Sector Programme (HNPSP), 2007–2010 \\n(25% nutrition and food security; about $4300 million, 37% external funding).\\nHNPSP has no available evaluation data, and disbursement up to July 2010 was about \\n5%, so the progamme appears to have been slow in starting activities. Components are \\ndescribed in the project appraisal document. The World Bank implementation completion \\nreport (1) on National Nutrition Program was critical of the plan and the ineffective \\nimplementation. This followed considerable earlier debate on the effectiveness of the BINP, \\nand most of the available data on process and outcome stem from this earlier programme. It \\nis not clear whether support to community nutrition promoters continued under the HNPSP.\\nDuring BINP internal evaluations were commissioned ( 2), then challenged by Save the \\nChildren (3) based on a retrospective cross-sectional survey. White and Massett ( 4) \\nconcluded that the reduction in malnutrition (underweight or stunting) which could be \\nascribed to BINP activities was about 2 ppt (about 0.3 ppt/year). However, early data did \\nshow an initial substantial reduction in severe underweight, as in other projects, and about \\n20 g improvement in birth weight was attributed to BINP activities.\\nProgramme design was similar to that for TINP, involving growth monitoring, with \\nsupplementary feeding for children with growth faltering and nutrition counselling. Reasons \\nfor low effectiveness may include:\\n■■ targeting for supplementary feeding was fairly ineffective, and food was shared;\\n■■ community nutrition promoters were of low intensity (approximately 1:150 households) \\nand worked out of community nutrition centres rather than making home visits;\\n■■ while there was some effect on knowledge and to a lesser degree on practices, these \\ndid not translate into nutritional impact.\\nBINP itself was of low effectiveness and did not lead to a sustainable set of actions. In part \\nthis was due to the project design and inadequate intensity, and in part to complexities in \\nimplementation (institutional and otherwise). Under the HNPSP there appears to be less \\nemphasis on community-based actions and services.'),\n",

Nutrition Programme Case Studies\\nBrazil\\nThe Child Pastorate Programme was implemented in 1983 by the Catholic Church of Brazil. \\nIt remains in operation to the time of writing and is funded by multiple sources, including \\nthe MoH (80%), Electric Company, Ministry of Education, the GLOBO television network \\nand UNICEF. In 2001 Child Pastorate Programme coverage by area was about 63% \\n(5140/8159 parishes), providing services to 32 265 communities. Coverage by population \\nfor the same year was about 1.6 million children less than 6 years of age (9.8% of total \\npopulation for age group), in addition to more than 77 000 pregnant women. Resource \\nintensity for the Child Pastorate Programme is US$ 4/person per year and personnel \\nintensity is 1 community worker:37 children less than 6 years of age. Total funding for the \\nprogramme for 1999–2000 was US$ 6.9 million.\\nInternal evaluations were conducted from 1988–2001 with reported decreases in \\nmalnourished children (from 18% to 4%) and pregnant women (from 20% to 4%), as well \\nas low birth weight (from 14% to 6%). An increase in EBF during the first 4 months was also \\nreported (from 60% to 80%). External evaluation data are unavailable. \\nThe Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) was implemented in Brazil in 1997 \\nand by 2002 had begun in all states, within the context of the Family Health Programme, \\nwhich is supported by the World Bank and the MoH. Coverage reported for the Family \\nHealth Programme is variable since municipalities must apply to the federal government and \\nmake a financial contribution to join the programme. Teams are trained in both Family Health \\nProgramme and IMCI principles though IMCI training is lagging behind that of FHP. Intensity \\nof CHWs is reported as 1 per 100–200 families ( 5). The impact of IMCI on nutritional status \\nin Brazil has not been reported. \\nBolsa Alimentacão was a CCT programme from 2001–2003, when it merged with several \\nprogrammes to form the current Bolsa Familia Programme (BFP). Coverage of Bolsa \\nAlimentacão in 2003 was 1.5 million persons (about 1% of the population) supported by the \\nWorld Bank and managed by the MoH. Families with pregnant or lactating women and/or \\nchildren less than 7 years of age with a monthly per capita income below US$ 42 received \\nUS$ 7 per child monthly, for up to 3 children. Conditions for receipt of the transfer included \\nregular pre- and postnatal care, growth monitoring, immunization, and participation in \\nnutrition education seminars ( 6). \\nInitial evaluation data from Bolsa Alimentacão showed worsening height-for-age z-scores \\n(HAZ) and weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) for beneficiaries compared to non-beneficiaries, \\nthough results were not statistically significant ( 7). This result was despite a reported \\nincrease in food consumption, which may have been due to beneficiary mothers assuming \\nthey would be ineligible for benefits if children were healthy. \\nThe Bolsa Alimentacão programme was incorporated into the BFP in 2003. BFP coverage \\nin 2006 was 11.1  million families (46 million persons), approximately 100% of the poor \\nand 25% of the total Brazilian population. Public expenditure for the BFP in 2005 was US$ \\n3.2 billion, equivalent to 0.36% of GDP ( 6). World Bank support for the programme was \\nabout US$ 562 million from 2003–2009, or approximately US$ 93.7 million/year ( 8). The \\nentire BFP is overseen by the Ministry of Social Development, while the health component \\nis managed by the MoH. Monthly cash transfers range from US$ 7–US$ 45 per family \\ndepending upon eligibility as determined by monthly per capita income ceilings of US$ \\n57 (moderately poor) and US$ 29 (extremely poor). Targeting of pregnant and lactating \\nmothers and children less than 7 years of age and health conditions for receipt of the \\ntransfer remain as they did in Bolsa Alimentacão.'),\n",

In 2004, approximately \\n80 000 Hogares Comunitarios were in operation nationally, with an average of 12 children \\nattending each (maximum 15); about 1 million children 6 years of age and younger attend. \\nSupplementary feeding is a major programme component, as children are provided lunch \\nand two snacks daily in addition to a supplemental beverage; in total 70% of daily caloric \\nneeds are provided ( 9). \\nEvaluation data for Hogares Comunitarios reported an increase in HAZ in children 0–72 \\nmonths based on variables of programme attendance/participation (0.486), of number of \\nmonths in the programme (0.013), and of the exposure (number of months adjusted by age \\nof child) to Hogares Comunitarios (0.78). Changes in WAZ were not significant. \\nFamilias en Acción is a large-scale CCT programme that began in 2002 and remains \\nin operation at the time of writing. It is implemented by the Colombian government and \\nsupported by both the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank; total annual \\nfunding in 2004 was US$ 95 million. Coverage of Familias en Acción in 2005 was 66% \\nof municipalities (700/1060) and 5% of the population, roughly 400 000 households or \\n2.1 million persons (10). Children 7 years of age and younger in the lowest income category \\nare targeted for the programme, which includes roughly the poorest 20% of households \\n(11). The nutrition/health component transfer for Familias en Acción is US$ 17/month per \\nmother, independent of the number of children in the household, which is equivalent to \\napproximately 24% of total household expenditure ( 12). Conditions for receipt of the transfer \\ninclude regular health visits and growth monitoring. \\nEvaluation data of Familias en Acción has demonstrated an increase in HAZ score of 0.161 \\nin children less than 24 months of age; though this increase is not significant, it translates to \\na 6.9% decrease in the risk of being chronically undernourished ( 11). In addition, Familias \\nen Acción participants in urban areas experienced an increase in newborn weight of 57.8 \\ng. This finding should be interpreted with caution since the programme was targeted to \\nchildren, not mothers.'),\n",

Key nutrition activities of the NNP include:\\n1. Health Extension Programme (HEP)\\n2. Promotion of Essential Nutrition Actions\\n3. Community-based Nutrition (CBN)\\n4. Therapeutic Feeding Programme (TFP)\\n5. Enhanced Outreach Strategy (EOS)/ Extended Enhanced Outreach Strategy (EEOS) \\nand Targeted Supplementary Feeding (TSF).\\nThe HEP (2005–time of writing) is the core strategy for universal primary health service \\ncoverage. The programme, operating with multi-donor support, aims to improve family health \\nstatus through disease prevention and control at the community level. Under the HEP, \\nthe Government of Ethiopia aimed for a ratio of 1 health extension worker (HEW):2500 \\npersons and 1 health post:5000 persons. After year-long training, HEWs deliver preventive, \\npromotive and selected curative activities according to 16 modules. These incorporated \\nIMCI (from 2002) and Essential Nutrition Actions (from 2004). As of 2009, 83% of target \\nkebeles (sub-districts) had health post coverage, and 100% of the target HEWs (30 000) \\nhad been trained and deployed. However, resource intensity for the programme remains low: \\nGovernment of Ethiopia spending on health is only 7.5% of the total government budget, \\nand total per capita public health expenditure was US$ 3.00 in 2008, below the target \\nexpenditure of US$ 4.80 per capita estimated for full implementation of the HEP ( 13). \\nThe CBN (2008 –present) was launched in 2008 and will expand to cover 35% of \\nEthiopia’s total population (228 woredas1) by the first half of 2011. CBN is focused on \\nchildren under two and uses monthly growth monitoring and promotion to involve families \\nand community members in assessing health and nutrition-related problems, analysing \\ncauses of these problems, taking action and monitoring progress. Other important \\nprocesses in CBN include strengthened referral of severely underweight children to \\nTFPs and/or TSFs as required; control of micronutrient deficiencies through biannual \\nvitamin A supplementation and deworming; and quarterly screening for acute malnutrition \\nthrough Community Health Days. CBN activities are facilitated by HEWs and voluntary \\nCHWs (1:30–50 households). Per capita costs are not available. Initial analysis of routine \\nprogramme data from 1.5 million under-2 children weighed in 4 regions showed a decline in \\nunderweight from 30% in January 2009 to 20% in March 2010 (8 ppt/year). 2 \\nIn TFPs (2008–present), children with complicated SAM receive care through therapeutic \\nfeeding units, and children with uncomplicated SAM are managed in the community through \\nOutpatient Therapeutic Programmes (OTP) at decentralized sites.

Nutrition Programme Case Studies\\nEOS/TSF Programmes (2004–present) are jointly operated by the MoH with UNICEF \\nsupport and the Disaster Risk Management and Food Security Sector with World Food \\nProgramme support. The EOS targets children 6–59 months for vitamin A supplementation, \\nmeasles vaccination, insecticide-treated bednets in malarial areas, health messages and \\ndeworming. Children 6–59 months and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) are also \\nscreened using mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). Those identified as moderately \\nmalnourished are referred to TSF for 3-month supplementary food rations, where available \\n(14). The EOS/TSF programme began in 2004 as a pilot, and quickly scaled up to cover \\n6.8 million children in 365 drought-prone woredas. In 2005/6, the programme was \\nexpanded through the EEOS, which covers additional woredas with a reduced package \\nof only vitamin A supplementation and deworming. National coverage by EOS and EEOS \\nhas expanded to reach around 95% of children under 5, at an estimated cost of US$ 1.14 \\nper child.1 In 2008, the programme covered 163 food-insecure woredas (2.9 million \\nchildren 6–59 months and 600 000 PLW), provided targeted supplementary food to \\n720 000 children and 420 000 PLW, and cost about US$ 43 million. Under HEP, the EOS \\nprogramme is currently phasing out and being replaced by Community Health Days. These \\nevents will offer the same inputs as EOS but will move away from the regionally-supported \\nbiannual mobilizations and instead be carried out quarterly, supported by the district health \\nstructures and HEWs (15). \\nThe PSNP (2005–present) is a partnership between the GoE and a group of donors \\nproviding direct budgetary support through a multi-donor trust fund. Outside of South \\nAfrica, PSNP is the largest social protection programme in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2009, \\nPSNP reached nearly 10% of the country (7.6 million people), covering more than 40% \\nof the woredas. The annual budget is around US$ 360 million. Per capita, cash and food \\ntransfers totaled US$ 32.8 for male-headed households and US$ 37.1 for female-headed \\nhouseholds in 2007 (16). PSNP employs geographic, administrative and community-based \\ntargeting to identify chronically food-insecure populations. The objective of the programme \\nis to improve food security and prevent vulnerable households from having to sell assets \\n(nutrition is not explicitly addressed). Cash and/or in-kind support is provided to targeted \\nhouseholds in exchange for labour-intensive public works to build community assets. Labour-\\npoor households (i.e. female-headed households with young children, the elderly, PLWs) \\nreceive unconditional transfers. An impact evaluation in 2008 found no significant change in \\nanthropometric status of children in PSNP households compared to non-PSNP households. \\nHowever, participation had positive effects on use of education and health services and \\nhousehold food security, caloric acquisition, and asset protection ( 17). \\n1 UNICEF Ethiopia, personal communication, 2010.'),\n",

AIN-C is supported by the Honduran MoH, and received \\nmajor funding from United States Agency for International Development from 1998–2005 \\n(initial planning and support began in 1991). Coverage of the programme by area was 24 \\nof 42 health areas (>50%) in 2006 (18), and by population was 90% of children less than \\n24 months of age. Intensity as measured by CHNWs:children is 3:25, where CHNWs work \\npart-time for 3.5 hours weekly. Financial resource intensity is US$ 6.43/child per year ( 18). \\nThe programme is targeted at children less than 24 months of age and sick children 24–\\n60 months of age. Activities of the AIN-C are carried out at monthly growth monitoring and \\npromotion sessions at the community centre, although home visits are provided for children \\nwho do not attend. Components of the programme include nutrition counselling for EBF \\nless than 6 months of age, complementary feeding less than 24 months of age, and hygienic \\npractices; micronutrient distribution for children (iron and vitamin A); medication distribution \\nfor illness; antenatal care (newborn visits); and referral to the health facility as needed ( 19).\\nEvaluation of the AIN-C was planned as a pre- and post-intervention, project and control \\ncomparison study, but the design was altered due to extensive contamination of control \\ncommunities, non-equivalent groups, and reduced intensity of programme implementation \\ndue to changes in funding. A cross-sectional study using baseline data compared AIN-C \\nparticipants to non-participants. Improved caring practices were reported among AIN-C \\nmothers. A 15.8 ppt difference in EBF at 6 months was found (55.8% AIN-C, 40% non-\\nAIN-C). With regard to receiving iron and vitamin A supplementation, differences of 36.1 \\nppt (65.6% AIN-C, 29.5% non-AIN-C) and 6.8 ppt (94.3% AIN-C, 87.5% non-AIN-C) \\nrespectively, were reported for children.

Since a pre-/\\npost- comparison was not possible, this conclusion cannot be certain ( 20). Intensity of \\nparticipation in the programme was based on percentage of possible weighings attended \\nby the child; after controlling for household assets and age of child, for every 1% increase in \\nparticipation intensity, weight-for-age increased 0.005 z-score ( 20).'),\n",

Nutrition Programme Case Studies\\nIndia\\nTwo major health and nutrition programmes were evaluated: Integrated Child Development \\nScheme (ICDS) and Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Programme (TINP). TINP 1, funded \\nby the World Bank, operated from 1980 to 1989 and TINP II operated from 1990 to 1997. \\nICDS was initiated by the Government of India (GoI) in 1975 and continues today. From \\n1990 to 1997, the World Bank supported ICDS I in Orissa and Andhra Pradesh, and from \\n1993 to 2001, supported ICDS II in Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.\\nAn important conclusion to draw from this analysis of large-scale nutrition programmes in \\nIndia is that a lack of proper evaluation is a major constraint to the development of evidence-\\nbased nutrition policies. \\nTINP I (1980–1989)\\nAmong TINP participants, there was an approximate 1.25 to 2.40 ppt/ year decline in \\nunderweight prevalence. In TINP areas, there was an approximate 0.83 to 1.12 ppt/year \\ndecline in underweight prevalence as compared with non-TINP areas where an approximate \\n0.26 to 1.12 ppt/year decrease in underweight prevalence was observed. The estimated \\nunderlying trend for the whole of India during this time was a 0.7 ppt/year decrease in \\nunderweight prevalence. Thus an estimated one quarter to one half of the decrease in \\nunderweight prevalence is attributable to the project.\\nThere are important issues related to data sources. Data on residents in TINP and non-\\nTINP areas (rather than on TINP participants) come from the National Nutrition Monitoring \\nBureau (NNMB) while data on TINP participants comes from programme monitoring \\nrecords. NNMB estimates are from an 11-year period (1979–1990) while TINP estimates \\nare from an 8-year period (1982–1990). Furthermore, NNMB surveys consistently produce \\nhigher estimated underweight prevalence than TINP surveys because NNMB surveys cover \\nentire areas rather than only programme participants. This may reveal differences between \\nparticipants and non-participants.\\nTINP II (1990–1997)\\nTINP II built off the lessons learned during TINP I. The components of TINP II remained the \\nsame as those in TINP II, although additional components were added.\\nAmong TINP II participants, there was an approximate 6.0 ppt/year decrease in underweight \\nprevalence. In TINP areas, there was an average 1.1 ppt/year decline in underweight \\nprevalence. The underlying trend in Tamil Nadu at that time was estimated by the \\nWorld Bank to be 5.0–7.0 ppt/year, which is most certainly an overestimate. In its 1998 \\nImplementation Completion Report for TNIP I, the World Bank suggests 2.0 ppt/year as a \\nmore realistic estimate of the underlying nutritional trend in Tamil Nadu. \\nOverall, TINP II was found to be successful in achieving its objective to decrease severe \\nmalnutrition but not successful in achieving its objective for moderate malnutrition. The latter \\nobjective may have been too ambitious, and underlying trends may have been overestimated.\\nICDS (1975–present)\\nIn 1998, ICDS was implemented in approximately 45% of the poorest villages and 60% of \\nthe richest villages in India. Universal coverage is a major goal of the programme, although \\nit has proven difficult to reach certain remote areas and vulnerable groups. A major issue \\nrelated to the effectiveness of the programme is the fact that coverage is much higher in'),\n",

Using propensity score matching, the difference \\nbetween HAZ scores among “cases” and “controls” was found to be only 0.056 in 1992 \\nand 0.024 in 1998.

None of the differences was statistically significant. These figures (derived from \\nNational Family Health Surveys) can be used only to investigate differences at one point in \\ntime, rather than to examine trends year to year, and thus provide for only weak attribution of \\nchanges to programme activities.\\nICDS I (1990–1997) \\nBetween 1990 and 1997, the World Bank supported ICDS activities in Andhra Pradesh and \\nOrissa. \\nAccording to programme monitoring data, the decrease in underweight prevalence was \\nfound to be approximately 3.2 ppt/year in Andhra Pradesh and 0.05 ppt/year in Orissa.

The underlying trend in underweight prevalence was estimated to be \\n2.8 ppt/year in Orissa and 4.2 ppt/year in Andhra Pradesh.

Nutrition Programme Case Studies\\nIndonesia\\nThe Family Nutrition Improvement Programme (UPGK) ran from 1975 to 1990, followed by \\nthe Third Community Health and Nutrition Project (CHN3) from 1993 to 2000. They were \\nsupported by the World Bank and combined participation and inputs from the MoH as well \\nas from the community.\\nThe UPGK (centred on Posyandus) projects were based on the strategy of consistent \\nmonthly weight gain in healthy children targeting children under five and their mothers. The \\nactivities included weighing, education, micronutrient supplementation and supplementary \\nfeeding in combination with other health interventions through weighing posts managed by \\ncommunity leaders and volunteers ( 25). The cost per beneficiary was US$ 2 for weighing-\\nscreening and US$ 11 per beneficiary for weighing-feeding. In all regions, 58 355 villages \\nreceived access to weighing posts, and coverage reached 17 million children or 80% of \\nthe under-5 population. Of those 80%, 77% received services and 47% were weighed \\nmonthly. Of those weighed monthly, 54% showed consistent weight gain, but active long-\\nterm participation ranged from only 34%–69% ( 26). The level of severe protein-energy \\nmalnutrition declined from 3%–5% to 1%. \\nBoth process and impact evaluations were performed on UPGK. A longitudinal study \\nshowed positive changes in health practices. However the degree to which these changes, \\nor any change in nutritional status of the programme target population, can be attributed \\nto the programme cannot be defined. Inclusion of too many other health issues may have \\ndiluted the nutrition interventions ( 27). Other evaluation results indicate high programme \\naccess and initial coverage above 80% but reduced active participation over time. A lack of \\nbaseline data makes impact difficult to assess. \\nCHN3 picked up where UPGK left off, running from 1993 to 2001 with a US$ 3.6 million \\ninvestment in improving nutritional status by the World Bank and US$ 0.6 million by the \\nGovernment of Indonesia. This project focused on capacity building, health information \\nsystems, education and service delivery in a province-based model in five provinces. From \\n1989 to 2003 underweight (<-2 SD WAZ) decreased from 37.5% to 27.5% (0.71 ppt/year) \\ndespite the financial crisis of the early 1990s. This decrease may be partially attributed to a \\nreduction in birthrate in the lowest quintile of the population ( 28). A World Bank evaluation \\nof the project determined that design made the project difficult to supervise and that poor \\nmonitoring and evaluation of performance made assessment of project effectiveness difficult \\nto determine (29). \\nImprovements in childhood malnutrition have been seen from the early 1980s. National level \\nprogrammes such as UPGK achieved strong access and initial coverage but met significant \\nproblems of sustained results, in part due to dilution of focus. Attempts to decentralize \\nhealth interventions to the provincial level with CHN3 faced challenges of implementation \\nand monitoring. Lack of baseline and surveillance data made effectiveness of these projects \\ndifficult to define.'),\n",

Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) were contracted to provide \\nservices to beneficiaries and supervision for community nutrition workers (CNWs) in target \\nareas. CNWs provided services at community nutrition centers and were paid in rice by \\nSECALINE for working on the project five days each week. The ratio of beneficiaries to \\nnutrition workers was approximately 400 to 1200 children and 200 women for each worker. \\nThe cost per child beneficiary was approximately US$ 7.31 per year. The programme \\nobjective was to reduce food insecurity and malnutrition in Madagascar’s two most food-\\ninsecure provinces through income generating projects and targeted nutrition programmes.\\nAccording to interim findings by the World Bank ( 30), there was a 14 ppt decrease in \\nunderweight prevalence among child participants in Antananarivo and a 10 ppt decrease in \\nunderweight prevalence among child participants in Toliary between January 1994 and June \\n1996. This amounted to a 5.6 ppt/year decrease in malnutrition in Antananarivo and a 4 ppt/ \\nyear decrease in malnutrition in Toliary. The programme was deemed successful and was \\nsubsequently scaled up to cover all regions in the country through SEECALINE (see below).\\nSEECALINE (1999–2003) \\nThe SEECALINE (Second Surveillance and Education for Schools and Communities on \\nFood and General Nutrition) programme began in 1999 and was gradually scaled-up until \\n2002.

The nutrition supplement is \\nintended to provide 20% of daily caloric and 100% of daily micronutrient requirements. \\nMultiple evaluations of Oportunidades have been conducted with data demonstrating \\nsignificant improvements in nutritional outcomes. In 2004, Rivera and colleagues ( 34) \\nreported an increase in height in children 0–6 months of 1.1 cm (26.4 cm versus 25.3 cm) \\nin programme beneficiaries compared to a control group ( 35). In rural children ages 12–24 \\nmonths, a significant increase in mean hemoglobin of 0.37 g/dl was found after 12 months \\nin the programme; 11.12 g/dl in the treatment group compared to 10.75 g/dl in the controls. \\nCorresponding anaemia prevalence among beneficiary children was 44.3% compared to \\n54.9% among control children, a significant 10.6 ppt decrease. Even with improvement, \\nnearly half of beneficiary children were still anaemic ( 34).\\nGertler (36) reported a significant increase in height of 0.96 cm in children 12–36 months in \\nthe treatment as compared to the control group, though there was no significant impact on \\nthe odds of being stunted. Treatment was defined as living in a locality covered by Progresa, \\ntherefore including children in households that were not receiving Progresa benefits. \\nThus, the estimates obtained from the study may be conservative ( 7). Anaemia prevalence \\nwas evaluated in rural children aged 12–48 months after 12 months in the programme; a \\nsignificant difference of 48.3% in beneficiary children compared to 41.1% in comparison \\nchildren was found (36). \\nA 2005 evaluation by Behrman and Hoddinott, as reviewed by Lagarde and colleagues ( 37), \\nfound a significant increase in height of 1.016 cm in children 12–36 months, although this \\noccurred in children whose mothers had greater than 5 years of schooling. \\nLeroy and colleagues (12) found a significant impact on height in children 0–6 months; an \\nincrease of 1.53 cm was seen in treatment children compared to control children. The mean \\nHAZ gain of 0.41 cm in this age group was also significant. When income/poverty tertiles \\nwere considered, a significant increase in height of 0.27 cm in the poorest tertile was found \\n(35). \\nBarber and Gertler ( 38) also reported positive impact of Oportunidades on nutritional \\noutcomes in 2008. They found a significantly higher birthweight of 127.3 g in programme \\nbeneficiaries and a 4.6 ppt reduction in LBW. When evaluated based on average beneficiary \\ntime, programme impact was 68.3 g, which was significant. Programme impact from cash \\nreceived was not significant at 78.2 g ( 35).'),\n",

It was a small-scale \\nCCT programme funded mainly by the Inter-American Development Bank, with contributions \\nfrom the Government of Nicaragua and the World Bank. Total funding was US$ 38 million. \\nThe RPS provided transfers for both nutrition/health and education upon meeting of certain \\nconditions by programme beneficiaries, although the education component will not be \\ndiscussed here. Coverage of the RPS in 2005 was about 165 000 persons, or 3% of the \\npopulation. Both geographical and household targeting was used for implementation in \\ndepartments and municipalities with high rates of extreme poverty. Intended beneficiaries \\nwere children 5 years of age and younger ( 7). \\nRPS participants received a nutrition/food security transfer equivalent to US$ 18/month \\nupon confirmation that conditions were met, although it has been reported that this was \\nnot strictly monitored. The transfer was equivalent to approximately 18% average monthly \\nhousehold expenditure. Conditions for receipt of the transfer included: monthly growth \\nmonitoring for children less than 24 months (every other month for children ages 2–5 years), \\nparticipation in nutrition and health education sessions on topics such as breastfeeding, \\nhygiene and feeding practices, regular vaccinations for children, and routine care for \\npregnant women. Antiparastic medications and iron supplements were also provided, \\nthough problems with delivery and noncompliance for iron have been reported ( 7). Supply-\\nside enhancements to ensure access to health care and ability to meet conditions were \\nimplemented as well by providing funding to private providers (mostly NGOs).\\nAvailable evaluation data from the RPS report a 19% improvement in per capita \\nconsumption in beneficiary households versus control households. Beneficiary household \\nconsumption was unchanged despite an economic crisis and drought while control \\nhousehold consumption decreased; the cash transfer may be beneficial in protecting \\nnutritional intake during times of crisis. An increase in HAZ of 0.17 was reported for \\nbeneficiary children and stunting decreased in RPS versus control groups by 5.5 ppt ( 39). A \\nsignificant change in underweight was also reported; it decreased in RPS areas (13.7% to \\n9.8%) while it increased in control areas (14.3% to 16.6%). Compared to national averages \\nfor this time period, the prevalence of underweight was much higher in both RPS and \\ncontrol areas. The cash transfer may have a greater impact in these rural, poor areas in times \\nof economic and environmental hardship. \\nAtención a Crisis ran from 2005–2006 as a pilot/experimental CCT programme designed \\nto help poor households in drought-affected regions of Nicaragua. Total funding was US$ \\n1.8 million, provided by the Ministry of Family. About 3000 households (approximately 16 \\n500 persons) in 6 municipalities that were affected by drought during the previous year were \\ntargeted by the programme. The food transfer amount was US$ 145/household per year \\n(US$ 24/every 2 months). Conditions for receipt of transfer included growth monitoring, \\nnutrition education and pre- and postnatal care for women. Supply-side benefits were \\nplanned for the programme but not implemented. \\nEvaluation data for Atención a Crisis show no impact on HAZ, WAZ or LBW. Due to the \\nshort duration of the programme and evaluation just after its completion, the lack of results is \\nunderstandable.'),\n",

Cost data \\n(40) estimate about US$ 500 per LHW/year, of which US$ 240 is stipend/salaries, about \\nUS$ 2.50/household per year, which may be too low to expect measurable impact. Social \\nexclusion is a key factor, not specifically addressed in the reports.\\nEvaluations showed good impact on some process indicators – e.g. immunization and \\ngrowth monitoring – although none on EBF ( 42). Child nutritional status was not measured; \\nthe only outcome seems to have been infant/child mortality rates. No impact was found, but \\nit could be due to lack of statistical power in the evaluation designs. \\nThere seem to be no child underweight estimates since 2001 – the 2006/2007 \\nDemographic and Health Survey did not include anthropometry.

The JNSP operated in 6/7 districts covering about \\n250 000 persons, 46 000 of whom were children (73% participation). Children less than \\n5 years of age and women were targeted, and selection was not based on socioeconomic \\nstatus. Resource intensity of the JNSP ranged from US$ 8–US$ 17/child per year \\n(US$ 30/child per year total cost, equivalent to US$ 6 million). Intensity as measured by \\npersonnel was 2 village health workers/village (1220 total) or 1:40 children. \\nJNSP evaluation data demonstrated a decrease in underweight from 50% to 35% (1984–\\n1988), or 4.5 ppt/year for the first 4 years of the programme. The decrease occurring in \\nthe first 2 years of the programme was even greater at 8 ppt/year, although the sustained \\ndecline in underweight in the population was 0.8 ppt/year (for years 2–7). The JNSP had \\ncomponents such as systems development and support, health services and water facilities, \\nbut these were not in place when the initial improvements in nutritional outcomes were seen. \\nThe reduction in malnutrition was attributed to increased feeding frequency, especially of \\nseverely underweight children at established child feeding posts, improved health care in \\nfamilies and communities and provision of information. \\nFollowing the success of the JNSP, the Child Survival and Development (CSD) Programme \\nwas initiated in 1985 and ran until 1995 with support from the World Bank. The programme \\naimed for complete coverage, although ultimately it was about 45% (9/20 regions), with \\napproximately 12 million beneficiaries, 2 million of whom were children. Resource intensity of \\nthe CSD programme was US$ 2–US$ 3/child per year ( 46).\\nAlthough coverage of the CSD programme was much greater than the JNSP and resource \\nintensity was less, evaluation demonstrates comparable results to those of the JNSP; an \\ninitial reduction in malnutrition of about 8 ppt/year for 1–2 years, then a continued decrease \\nof 1–2 ppt/year following the initial rapid decline. The difference in resource intensity may be \\ndue to the fact that supplementary feeding was not a component of the CSD programme. \\nIMCI was initiated in 1995 and is presently in operation with a goal of national coverage. It \\nis both facility- and community-based and supported by WHO and UNICEF. Coverage at \\nthe time of writing is varied. All 114 districts have received orientation and the majority (83% \\nin 2005) had carried out at least initial training. Resource intensity of IMCI is approximately \\nUS$ 11/child/year (US$ 1.70/child per year for routine care). IMCI has various components \\n(47). \\nEvaluation data from IMCI show a decrease in stunting, as measured by improvement in \\nconcentration indices in children aged 24–59 months in IMCI districts (-0.102 to -0.032) \\nin relation to comparison districts (-0.122 to -0.133) from 1999–2002 (48). Overall \\nstunting decreased from 59% to 43% in IMCI districts versus 51% to 40% in comparison \\ndistricts. Improvement in underweight was also seen in IMCI districts (-0.071 to -0.057) as \\ncompared to non-IMCI districts (-0.136 to -0.166). Corresponding percentage changes for \\nunderweight were 30%–23% in IMCI districts versus 27%–10% in comparison districts \\n(49). Further studies demonstrating effectiveness of the programme have not yet been \\nconducted. Several reported challenges in implementation have occurred, as the main \\nactivity remains training of health care workers without significant expansion to community-\\nbased practices. \\nChild Health Days (CHDs) were implemented in Tanzania beginning in 2000.

The causes of malnutrition are \\ndirectly related to inadequate dietary    intake as well \\nas disease, but indirectly to many factors, among \\nothers household food security, maternal and child \\ncare, health services and the environment. While \\nmost nutrition interventions   are delivered through \\nthe health sector, non-health interventions can also \\nbe critical. Actions should target the diﬀerent causes \\nto reach sustainable change, which requires a \\nmultisectoral  approach.\\nThis document includes WHO guidance on nutrition \\ninterventions targeting the /f_irst 1000 days of life. \\nFocusing on this package of essential nutrition \\nactions, policy-makers could reduce infant and    \\nchild mortality, improve physical and mental growth \\nand development, and improve productivity. Part I \\npresents the interventions currently recommended \\nby WHO, summarizes the rationale  and the \\nevidence, and describes the actions required to \\nimplement them. The document uses a life-course \\napproach, from pre-conception throughout the /f_irst \\ntwo years of life. Part II provides an analysis of \\ncommunity-based interventions aimed at improving \\nnutrition and indicates how eﬀective interventions \\ncan be delivered in an integrated fashion.\\nISBN 978 92 4 150555 0\\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT:\\nDepartment of Nutrition for Health and Development - World Health Organization\\n20, Avenue Appia  -  1211 Geneva 27  -  Switzerland - Fax: +41 22 791 4156 - Email: nutrition@who.int\\nwww.who.int/nutrition'),\n",

It also discusses the value of implementing such \\nprogrammes in an integrated fashion and with the adequate quality and \\nintensity. It is the first time that WHO provides such a summary, organized by stage of the life \\ncourse. \\nMost of the guidelines mentioned in the document (14 out of 24) have been recently developed \\nor updated following the new WHO guideline process, i.e. in ways consistent with best practice, \\nemphasizing the appropriate use of evidence. Systematic reviews of evidence are prepared to \\naddress critical outcomes for decision-making with consideration of the overall balance of risks \\nand benefits, values and preferences, and costs. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, \\nDevelopment and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology is used for assessing the quality of the \\nevidence and the strength of the recommendations. The whole process is implemented by WHO \\ntogether with experts of a high professional standard and devoid of conflict of interest, with oversight \\nby the WHO Guidelines Review Committee.\\nIn order to provide real time updates, WHO launched in 2011 the electronic Library of Evidence \\non Nutrition Actions (eLENA 2). eLENA is a simple web-based tool for academics, policy-makers, \\nhealth workers, and development partners containing links to WHO evidence-informed nutrition \\nrecommendations and the underlying evidence. eLENA also includes topics on which evidence has \\nstarted to accumulate but are still not the object of WHO guidance.\\nThe guideline process does not end with the publication of a document, but continues with \\ndissemination and assistance to policy-makers to adapt the guidance to the country context. \\nAdditional operational tools are often required, including analysis of cost and cost-effectiveness. \\nCosting is addressed by the OneHealth software, developed jointly by various United Nations \\nagencies and the World Bank. 3\\nThe importance of implementing at scale only interventions that have established evidence has \\nbeen stressed by the first series on maternal and child undernutrition published by the Lancet.4 \\nThis document is published simultaneously with a second Lancet series, providing an update of \\nthe evidence base of programmes. WHO is pleased to note that there is now full alignment in the \\nnutrition community on programme priorities.\\nBroad agreement on “what to do” has been one of the factors of the success of the Scaling-up \\nNutrition movement, that has generated unprecedented broader commitment of governments, \\ndonors and development actors to improve nutrition, towards the achievement, in 2025, of the \\nglobal nutrition targets established by the World Health Assembly. \\nOleg Chestnov\\nAssistant Director General\\nNoncommunicable Diseases and Mental Health\\n1 http://www.who.int/entity/nutrition/topics/WHA65.6_annex2_en.pdf\\n2 http://www.who.int/elena/en/index.html\\n3 http://www.futuresinstitute.org/onehealth.aspx\\n4 Horton R.

While most nutrition interventions are delivered through the health \\nsector, non-health interventions can also be critical. Actions should target the different causes to \\nreach sustainable change, which requires a multisectoral approach. \\nThis document provides a compact summary of WHO guidance on nutrition interventions targeting \\nthe first 1000 days of life. Focusing on this package of essential nutrition actions, policy-makers \\ncould reduce infant and child mortality, improve physical and mental growth and development, \\nand improve productivity. \\nPart I  presents the interventions currently recommended by WHO (see table on pages 8 to \\n9), summarizes the rationale and the evidence for each, and describes the actions required to \\nimplement them. The document uses a life-course approach, from pre-conception throughout the \\nfirst two years of life.\\nSome interventions require adequate behaviours, such as initiating breastfeeding soon after \\ndelivery, breastfeeding exclusively for six months and then continuing breastfeeding until two \\nyears and beyond. In order for those interventions to be successfully established action is needed \\nto promote healthy behaviours; to create a supportive environment, such as a conducive hospital \\nenvironment, skilled health workers, support in the community and the workplace; and protection \\nfrom commercial and other negative influences.\\nOther interventions require the provision of supplies in adequate amounts for all those in need \\nof them: iron and folic acid supplements, vitamin A supplements, multiple micronutrient powders \\nand ready-to-use therapeutic foods. \\nThe document highlights the circumstances in which the interventions have to be delivered, \\nsuch as the prevalence of different nutrition conditions, or the occurrence of special situations, \\nsuch as the presence of underlying disease (HIV infection, measles, diarrhoea) and emergency \\ncircumstances\\nThe document deals with interventions delivered through the health sector, while recognizing \\nthat other interventions delivered through a variety of sectors (agriculture, water and sanitation, \\neducation, etc.) also have important impacts on nutrition. A special mention is made of food \\nfortification, an intervention that requires the involvement of the health sector and actors in the \\nfood system.\\nPart II provides an analysis of community-based interventions aimed at improving nutrition and \\nindicates how effective interventions can be delivered in an integrated fashion. It shows how \\nthe essential nutrition actions described in the first part have been implemented in large-scale \\nprogrammes in various settings, what the outcomes have been, and to examine the evidence for \\nattribution of changes in nutritional outcomes to programme activities. Some background on the \\nevolution of programmatic evidence is given, and implications for the future are drawn.'),\n",

This situation applies to perinatal and infectious diseases as well as \\nchronic ones. \\nGlobally, in 2011 about 101 million children under 5 years of age were underweight and 165 \\nmillion stunted. At the same time, about 43 million children under 5 were overweight or obese (1). \\nAbout 90% of stunted children live in only 36 countries, and children under 2 years of age are \\nmost affected by undernutrition ( 2).1 Nearly 20 million children under 5 suffer from severe acute \\nmalnutrition, a life-threatening condition requiring urgent treatment.\\nIn 2011, 6.9 million children under 5 died, mostly from preventable causes such as pneumonia, \\ndiarrhoea, malaria and neonatal conditions (3, 4) (Figure 1); about 90% of these deaths occurred \\nin 42 countries, with half the worldwide deaths occurring in only 6 countries ( 5). Undernutrition \\nis associated with more than one third of those deaths ( 2, 6).\\nImprovement of exclusive breastfeeding practices, adequate and timely complementary feeding, \\nalong with continued breastfeeding for up to 2 years or beyond, could save the lives of 1.5 million \\nchildren under 5 years of age annually (7). Growth failure during intrauterine life and poor nutrition \\nin the first two years of life have critical consequences throughout the life-course. Appropriate \\nbreastfeeding and complementary feeding practices not only play a significant role in improving \\nthe health and nutrition of young children, they also confer significant long-term benefits during \\nadolescence and adulthood. An estimated 13 million children are born with intrauterine growth \\nrestriction every year ( 2).1 \\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 190 million children under five \\n(33.3% of the preschool age population) are vitamin A deficient, with about 5.2 million affected \\nby night blindness (9). Infants as well as young children have increased vitamin A requirements to \\n1 These figures will be updated as this report is published.\\nFigure 1.

Severe vitamin A deficiency (VAD) at this age can \\ncause visual impairments, anaemia and weakened immunity, with an increased risk of morbidity \\nand mortality from measles or diarrhoea ( 10). \\nVAD is also an issue for women. WHO estimates that 9.8 million women are affected by night \\nblindness, a problem related with insufficient vitamin A ( 11). \\nIron is the most common nutritional deficiency, with approximately 2 billion people worldwide \\naffected (12). WHO estimates that there are 469 million women of reproductive age and about \\n600 million preschool and school-age children worldwide anaemic, with at least half of these \\ncases attributable to iron deficiency (iron deficiency anaemia) ( 13).\\nInfants and children under the age of five are at risk of developing iron deficiency anaemia because \\nof their increased requirements for rapid growth and diets that are often lacking in sufficient \\nabsorbable iron ( 14, 15). Iron deficiency, with or without anaemia, may have important health \\nconsequences for young children, including increased perinatal mortality, delayed mental and \\nphysical development, negative behavioural consequences, reduced auditory and visual function, \\nand impaired physical performance ( 16). Some of the negative effects of iron deficiency during \\nearly childhood are irreversible and can lead to poor school performance, reduced physical work \\ncapacity and decreased productivity later in life ( 3, 11, 17, 18, 19).\\nMaternal short stature and iron deficiency anaemia, which can increase the risk of death of the \\nmother at delivery, contribute to at least 18% of maternal deaths in low- and middle-income \\ncountries ( 20). Anaemia rates have not improved appreciably over the past two decades ( 21). \\nMaternal undernutrition also increases the probability of low birth weight, which in turn increases \\nthe probability of neonatal deaths due to infections and asphyxia (22). Anaemia is also associated \\nwith an increased risk of maternal mortality ( 23). Globally, almost 50% of pregnant women \\n(56 million) are anaemic ( 4). Because adolescent girls and women of reproductive age lose \\niron through monthly menstruation, and because their diets are often lacking in iron, they are \\nparticularly vulnerable to iron deficiency ( 10, 23, 24).\\nIn 2008, 35% of adults aged 20 years and older were overweight (body-mass index [BMI] ≥ \\n25 kg/m2) (34% of men and 35% of women). The worldwide prevalence of obesity has nearly \\ndoubled between 1980 and 2008. In 2008, 14% of women in the world were obese (BMI ≥30 \\nkg/m2) (297 million over the age of 20), compared with 8% in 1980 ( 25, 26). \\nCauses of malnutrition\\nThe causes of malnutrition are directly related to inadequate dietary intake as well as disease, but \\nindirectly to many factors, among others household food security, maternal and child care, health \\nservices and the environment. While most nutrition interventions are delivered through the health \\nsector, non-health interventions can also be critical. Actions should target the different causes to \\nreach sustainable change, which requires a multisectoral approach. \\nTiming of interventions\\nNew analyses, using the WHO Growth Standards ( 27), confirm the importance of the first two \\nyears of life as a window of opportunity for growth promotion ( Figure 2). An important feature of \\nthe WHO standards is that they reveal a much greater problem of undernutrition during the first \\nsix months of life than previously believed, bringing coherence between the rates of undernutrition \\nobserved in young infants and the prevalence of low birth weight and early abandonment of \\nexclusive breastfeeding. These findings highlight the need for prenatal and early-life interventions \\nto prevent the growth failure that primarily happens during the first two years of life, including \\nthe promotion of appropriate infant feeding practices ( 28). The deficits acquired by this age are \\ndifficult to reverse later.\\nStrategies to improve nutritional status and growth in children should include interventions to \\nimprove nutrition of pregnant and lactating women; early initiation of breastfeeding with exclusive \\nbreastfeeding for six months; promotion, protection, and support of continued breastfeeding'),\n",

These essential actions protect, promote and support priority nutrition outcomes:\\n■■ exclusive breastfeeding for six months;\\n■■ adequate complementary feeding starting at six months with continued breastfeeding for two \\nyears;\\n■■ appropriate nutritional care of sick and malnourished children;\\n■■ adequate intake of vitamin A for women and children;\\n■■ adequate intake of iron for women and children; and\\n■■ adequate intake of iodine by all members of the household.\\nThe actions proposed to obtain the priority nutrition outcomes included ones that health workers \\ncould implement, such as complementary feeding counselling and active feeding, growth \\nmonitoring and promotion, and supplementary feeding or food-based interventions. At the same \\ntime, health managers aiming for adequate intake of vitamin A for women and children could \\nencourage daily intake of vitamin A-rich foods and adequate breastfeeding, give high-dose \\nvitamin A supplements to children with infections, train staff to detect and treat clinical VAD, and \\ndesign a plan for preventive supplementation of vitamin A for children and postpartum women in \\npopulations at risk of VAD.\\nImproving nutrition involves actions at health facility and population levels. At district level, these \\ncould include monitoring nutrition, identifying sub-populations at risk of nutrition problems, \\nupdating nutrition policies and protocols, and providing resources and tools to implement nutrition \\nactivities at health facilities and at community venues.\\nAt health facilities, ENAs should be carried out at all contacts with pregnant and lactating women \\nand their children.

In strengthening its commitment to providing relevant guidance for \\nprogrammes that support and develop capacity in evidence-informed policy-making to Member \\nStates, the WHO Department of Nutrition for Health and Development recently established \\nthe WHO Nutrition Guidance Expert Advisory Group with experts from WHO Advisory Panels \\nand other experts in the fields of epidemiology, nutrition, public health, paediatric medicine, and \\nprogramme implementation.

Interventions targeted at young \\ninfants (0–5 months)1\\n1.1 Early initiation of breastfeeding\\nWHO RECOMMENDATION\\nPlace babies in skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately following birth for \\nat least an hour and encourage mothers to recognize when their babies are ready to \\nbreastfeed, offering help if needed. ( 1)\\nRationale and evidence\\nWHO and UNICEF provided recommendations on early initiation of breastfeeding in 1989, and the \\nevidence was updated in 1998. Evidence for the importance of early initiation was systematically \\nreviewed again in 2007, in the context of early skin-to-skin contact. The review found a positive \\neffect on both the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for one to four months of life, and \\nthe overall duration of breastfeeding, when mothers put the infant to the breast soon after birth. \\nThe review also showed that babies interacted more with their mothers, stayed warmer and cried \\nless (2). A Cochrane review on community-based integrated packages to improve maternal and \\nneonatal health found that community-based programming had a positive impact on the initiation \\nof breastfeeding within one hour of birth ( 3). \\nEarly initiation promotes exclusiveness and duration of breastfeeding, but the relationship between \\nearly initiation of breastfeeding and improved health has not been so well established. However, a \\nrecent study in Ghana (4) showed evidence of a causal association between early breastfeeding \\nand reduced infection-specific neonatal mortality in young human infants.\\nThe recommendation for early initiation of breastfeeding stems from the 1989 WHO/UNICEF \\nJoint Statement Protecting, promoting and supporting breast-feeding: the special role of maternity \\nservices (5). An updated 1998 statement includes the ten steps for successful breastfeeding, \\nwith Step 4 indicating “Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within a half-hour of birth”. The updated \\nreview concluded that early contact increases breastfeeding both soon after delivery and two to \\nthree months later. Spontaneous suckling may not occur until between 45 minutes to 2 hours \\nafter birth, but skin-to-skin contact should start as soon as possible after delivery. Provided the \\ninfant is in close contact with his/her mother and can suckle when it shows signs of readiness, \\nthere is no justification for forcing him/her to take the breast ( 6). \\nA Cochrane systematic review ( 2) suggested that in industrialized societies, hospital routines \\nmay significantly disrupt early mother-infant interactions with harmful effects. It also showed that \\nbabies interacted more with their mothers, stayed warmer and cried less with early skin-to-skin \\ncontact. Babies were more likely to be breastfed, and to breastfeed for longer.\\n(For a summary of systematic reviews on early initiation of breastfeeding, see Table I-1.)\\n1 0–5 months refers to the period up to 180 days of life.'),\n",

( 7)\\nRationale and evidence\\nOne of the most effective and rewarding preventable interventions is breastfeeding, which \\ntogether with appropriate complementary feeding has the potential to reduce mortality among \\nchildren under five by 19% (8). Six months of EBF is recommended for improved infant, child, and \\nmaternal health. EBF from birth is possible except for a few medical conditions, and unrestricted \\nEBF results in ample milk production. The evidence stems from a systematic review in 2001 on \\nthe effects of EBF for six (versus three to four) months on infant and maternal health. The review \\nfound evidence of decreased gastrointestinal illnesses in infants who were exclusively breastfed \\nfor six months (compared to those who were mixed breastfed – receiving breast milk and other \\nmilk – at three to four months), and also that mothers who exclusively breastfed for six months \\nexperience prolonged lactational amenorrhea ( 9).\\nAn expert consultation in 2001 served to analyse the systematic review as well as to review the \\nnutrient adequacy of EBF ( 10) for six months ( 7). Based on the results, WHO recommended \\n“exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with introduction of complementary foods and continued \\nbreastfeeding thereafter” ( 11).\\nThe 2001 systematic review was updated to include six additional studies and was published in \\n2009 (12). The nearly identical results to those found previously reinforced WHO’s recommen -\\ndation of six months of EBF for improved health.\\n(For a summary of systematic reviews on EBF, see Table I-2.)\\nActions to protect, promote and support breastfeeding\\nThe Global strategy for infant and young child feeding , adopted by the World Health Assembly \\n(WHA) and the UNICEF Executive Board in 2002, provides the framework for action to protect, \\npromote and support breastfeeding.

The main elements of the Code deal with information \\nand education; advertising and promotions to mothers and health workers; labelling; quality; and \\nimplementation and monitoring. \\nTo maximize the contribution that the Code can make to improved breastfeeding, given the many \\nexamples of non-compliance, in-country monitoring of its implementation should be carried out \\n(17, 18). Companies found to be committing violations should be sanctioned by the government \\nentity charged with Code enforcement. Having all companies that produce infant formula compete \\nfor market share in a manner consistent with the Code will benefit these companies by ensuring \\nthat no company is given an unfair advantage ( 19). \\nImproving maternity protection and health through the workplace\\nMaternity protection at work is essential for safe-guarding the health and economic security of \\nwomen and their children. This consensus is reflected in the international labour standards of \\nthe ILO, which set out basic requirements for maternity protection at work. Many countries have \\nratified Maternity Protection Convention No. 183, and others have adopted some of its provisions \\n(20). Health professionals have an important role to play in advocating for good legislation on \\nmaternity protection, and hospitals and other health facilities should offer maternity leave and \\nbreastfeeding support for their own personnel. All working women should be supported to \\nsustain breastfeeding when they return to work, and in the workplace they should be granted a \\nminimum of one daily break with pay, to breastfeed their infant or express and store breast milk \\n(21, 22, 23, 24). \\nBaby-friendly Hospital Initiative (1, 25, 26) \\nWHO conducted a review of the evidence to support the implementation of the Ten steps for \\nsuccessful breastfeeding  (27) and an update is underway. A review on interventions to promote \\nbreastfeeding found that BFHI is effective in increasing EBF rates (28). The BFHI has a systematic \\nrecertification process to ensure that its rigorous standards are upheld. Many hospitals that \\nwere certified in the past no longer meet the criteria and require recertification. Revitalization \\nof the BFHI also requires capacity building in breastfeeding counselling and clinical aspects \\nof lactation management. To enforce the monitoring of the BFHI criteria on a routine basis, \\nconsideration should be given to making fulfilment of the criteria a part of the overall system of \\nquality certification of hospitals ( 29).\\nCounselling and support for appropriate breastfeeding at community and facility level\\nOne-on-one breastfeeding counselling is particularly effective in promoting EBF. Maternal \\ncounselling during pregnancy, immediately after child birth and at key moments in the postnatal \\nperiod has large and significant effects on EBF rates. The evidence of the effect of interventions on \\nbreastfeeding practices is less clear than the biological and behavioural effects of breastfeeding on \\nhealth. Best practices to increase EBF, and thus improve health, were reviewed in a Lancet series \\non maternal and child undernutrition (30). The review showed counselling is particularly effective \\nin promoting EBF. As compared to control groups, EBF increased among mothers during the \\nneonatal period (OR 3.45, 95% CI 2.20–5.42) and at 6 months of age (OR 1.39, CI 1.18–3.15) \\nwhen exposed to individual, one-on-one counselling. Group counselling was shown to increase \\nEBF during the neonatal period (OR 3.88, CI 2.09–7.22) and at 6 months of age (OR 5.19, CI \\n1.90–14.15) compared to control groups. Maternal counselling during pregnancy, immediately \\nafter childbirth and at key moments in the postnatal period had large and significant effects on \\nEBF. Promotion of breastfeeding through mass media was shown effective at increasing EBF \\nduring the 6-month postnatal period by between 7% and 70% in the exposed population, with \\nthe largest impact seen in mothers with infants 1 to 4 months of age ( 13). Studies specifically \\nlooking at the impact of education or counselling on child weight showed that children whose'),\n",

In 2006, WHO updated the guidance on HIV and infant \\nfeeding. Significant programmatic experience and research evidence regarding HIV and infant \\nfeeding have accumulated since then, as reflected in the 2010 Guidelines; in particular, it is \\nnow known that ARV interventions to either the HIV-infected mother or the HIV-exposed infant \\nsignificantly reduce the risk of postnatal transmission of HIV through breastfeeding. This evidence \\nhas had major implications for how women living with HIV should feed their infants and how \\nhealth workers should counsel and support them. \\nNine key principles underlie the seven evidence-based recommendations above. The principles \\nreflect a set of values that contextualize the provision of care in programmatic settings. The key \\nprinciples are directed towards policy-makers, academics and health workers.\\nKEY PRINCIPLES ON HIV AND INFANT FEEDING\\n1. Balancing HIV prevention with protection from other causes of child mortality.\\n2.  Integrating HIV interventions into maternal and child health services.\\n3.  Setting national or sub-national recommendations for infant feeding in the context of \\nHIV.\\n4.

Avoiding harm to infant feeding practices in the general population.\\n8.  Advising mothers who are HIV uninfected or whose HIV status is unknown.\\n9.  Investing in improvement in infant feeding practices in the context of HIV.\\nRecommendation 1 is based on the revised WHO recommendations for ARV therapy or \\nprophylaxis to reduce HIV transmission, including through breastfeeding ( 35). \\nRecommendation 2 is based on a systematic review of the effect of different infant feeding \\npractices, in the absence of ARVs, on HIV-free survival and other mortality. Decreased HIV \\ntransmission in the first six months of infant life was associated with EBF compared to mixed \\nfeeding. EBF in the first six months of life was also associated with reduced mortality over the \\nfirst year of life in HIV-exposed infants. The risk of HIV transmission continues for as long as \\nbreastfeeding continues; despite this, HIV-free survival of HIV-exposed infants who breastfed \\nbeyond six months of age was better than of infants who were started on replacement feeds.\\nRecommendation 3 is based on research and programmatic experience reporting that rapid and \\nabrupt cessation of breastfeeding was very difficult for mothers to achieve and was associated \\nwith adverse consequences for the infant; breast-milk viral load is also known to spike with rapid \\ncessation of breastfeeding.\\nFor Recommendation 4, the very considerable evidence from non HIV-exposed populations was \\nrelevant and justifiable to use to inform how HIV-infected mothers should feed their infants in the \\nabsence of breast milk.

Breastfed children at 12–23 months of age receive on average 35% to 40% of total energy \\nneeds from breast milk ( 39) with the remaining 60% to 65% covered by complementary foods. \\nBreast milk is a key source of energy and essential fatty acids and provides substantial amounts \\nof certain micronutrients. The nutritional impact of breastfeeding is most evident during periods \\nof illness, when the child’s appetite for other foods decreases but breast-milk intake is maintained \\n(40). Continued, frequent breastfeeding also protects child health by delaying maternal fertility \\npostpartum and reducing the child’s risk of morbidity and mortality in disadvantaged populations \\n(41, 42). Longitudinal studies demonstrate that in developing countries, a longer duration of \\nbreastfeeding is associated with greater linear growth ( 43, 44 ). It is also linked to reduced \\nrisk of childhood chronic illnesses ( 45) and obesity ( 46) and to improved cognitive outcomes \\n(47), although the causal relationship underlying these associations remains controversial. \\nBreastfeeding in the first 6 months of life provides greater protection against diarrhoea than \\nagainst acute respiratory illness (OR=6.1 vs. OR=2.4), but breastfeeding between 6–11 months \\nshows “similar levels of protection” against both acute respiratory illness and diarrhoea (OR=1.9 \\nvs. OR=2.5) (3 studies) ( 42).

A working definition refers to complementary \\nfeeding as the process starting when breast milk or infant formula alone is no longer sufficient \\nto meet the nutritional requirements of infants, and therefore other foods and liquids are needed, \\nalong with breast milk or a breast-milk substitute. The target range for complementary feeding is \\ngenerally taken to be 6 to 23 months (16, 49, 50). \\nA critical window of opportunity to ensure optimal child growth and development covers the \\nperiod of pregnancy up to the second year of life ( 51, 52). Successful complementary feeding \\nis critical for preventing malnutrition. Growth faltering is most evident during this time period, \\nparticularly between 6 and 12 months when foods of low nutrient density begin to replace breast \\nmilk and rates of diarrhoeal illness caused by food contamination are at their highest. After about \\ntwo years of age, it is very difficult to reverse stunting that occurred at earlier ages. \\nThe evidence that feeding practices and diet affect growth and development of children (sequence \\n1 in Figure I-1) is summarized by WHO (53) and others, especially Dewey and Brown (39). The \\nrelationship of nutrient requirements, feeding frequency, energy density and feeding practices to \\nadequate growth and development is considered well supported by the available evidence, which \\nincludes clearly understood mechanisms. \\nFigure I-1 How feeding practices and diet affect growth and development 1\\nIntervention, e.g.\\n• Counselling\\n• Technology\\n• Provision of additional\\n food\\nIntermediate outcome, e.g.\\n• Feeding practices\\n• Diet quantity and quality\\nHealth/nutritional outcomes\\n• Child growth and development\\n3\\n2 1\\nThe main issues have become how to optimize these practices (intermediate outcomes) with \\ninterventions (sequence 2 in Figure I-1).

In addition to iron, vitamin A and zinc, multiple micronutrient powders may contain other \\nvitamins and minerals at currently recommended nutrient intake (RNI) doses for the target population ( 60). \\nb 12.5 mg of elemental iron equals 37.5 mg of ferrous fumarate, 62.5 mg of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate or 105 mg of \\nferrous gluconate.\\nRationale and evidence\\nIn lower-income settings, children’s diets may be primarily plant-based. A lack of animal-source \\nfoods in these settings results in insufficient amounts of key micronutrients such as vitamin A, \\nzinc, and iron, to meet the recommended intakes for children less than 24 months of age. WHO \\nestimates globally that 190 million preschool children are vitamin A deficient ( 61) and more than \\ntwo thirds of children are anaemic in Africa and south-east Asia. Infants and young children \\nare also most susceptible to the harmful consequences of these deficiencies. A compromised \\nimmune status resulting from poor nutritional status can directly lead to an increased risk of \\ninfectious diseases and potentially elevated rates of infant morbidity and mortality ( 62). \\nSupplementation has been proposed as one of the best available nutrition interventions to address \\nthese vitamin and mineral deficiencies, as it can be targeted to some of the most vulnerable \\npopulation groups, such as those living in remote regions, as well as young children ( 63). The \\nMNPs were developed as an alternative to supplementation and have shown to be successful \\nin reducing anaemia and iron deficiency in young children in a variety of contexts as they can \\nbe added directly to food ( 64, 65 ). MNPs are frequently packaged in small sachets which are \\ntemperature and moisture resistant ( 66), giving them a long shelf-life and easing transportation \\nand storage problems (67). These characteristics reduce the frequency of distribution necessary \\nto maintain a supply of micronutrients ( 68). \\nMild side effects can occur with supplementation, such as darkened stools, gastrointestinal pain, \\ndiarrhoea, constipation and vomiting (69). Though MNPs do not eliminate these side effects, they \\ndo appear to reduce their frequency and severity and are highly acceptable ( 70). Iron is covered \\nin a fat-based protective coating so that the taste, colour and aroma of food change minimally \\nwithout greatly affecting children’s dietary habits.The fortification of foods using MNPs can be \\ndone at home or any other locations where meals are prepared and consumed, such as schools \\nor hospitals. This method of fortification is thus referred to as point-of-use ( 71).'),\n",

The mechanisms by which vitamin A saves lives are not fully understood, and it is not \\nclear whether its action is mediated through the correction of underlying deficiencies or through \\nadjuvant therapeutic effects. Vitamin A supplements may improve gut integrity and therefore \\ndecrease the severity of some cases of diarrhoea (78). The role of vitamin A in immunity may also \\naffect the susceptibility and/or severity of other infections ( 79, 80). \\nMany countries have integrated vitamin A supplementation for infants and children into national \\nhealth policies and routine health services, for example through biannual ”special days” where \\nsupplementation is combined with other child survival interventions such as deworming or \\nnutrition education (81, 82). Vitamin A supplements are also commonly distributed as part of the \\nExpanded Programme on Immunization, particularly at nine months with measles vaccinations. In \\n2009, approximately 77% of preschool children were estimated to have received two doses of \\nsupplements per year in more than 103 priority countries ( 83). \\nProvision of a high dose of vitamin A every six months until the age of five years has been based \\non the principle that a single high dose of vitamin A is highly absorbed, stored as a fat-soluble \\nvitamin in the liver and mobilized over an extended period of time as needed. In infants 6–11 \\nmonths of age doses of 100 000 IU and in children 12–59 months of age 200 000 IU have been \\nconsidered to provide adequate protection for 4 to 6 months ( 84). Most children in this age \\ngroup tolerate these doses of vitamin A well, though temporary side effects such as headache, \\nnausea or vomiting and diarrhoea have been reported in a small percentage of cases ( 85). On \\na per-child basis, the cost of vitamin A supplementation is considered inexpensive. Most of the \\nvitamin A used during supplementation campaigns is supplied in gelatin capsules, which cost \\napproximately US$ 0.02 each ( 86), with an estimated cost of US$ 1 to US$ 2 for delivery per \\nchild per year. The total cost of supplementation per death averted is estimated at US$ 200 to \\nUS$ 250 (87). \\nTwo Cochrane reviews were recently updated to systematically evaluate the most recent \\nevidence on vitamin A supplementation in children ( 77, 88). The first examined the effects and \\nsafety of vitamin A supplementation for the prevention of morbidity and mortality among children \\n6–59 months of age (77). Results of the review showed that supplementation with vitamin A can \\nreduce mortality and the prevalence rates of communicable diseases such as diarrhoea. The \\nmeta-analysis included 17 clinical trials and indicated that vitamin A supplementation reduces the \\nrisk of all-cause mortality by 24%. Another review assessed the effects and safety of a number \\nof micronutrients, including vitamin A, in reducing morbidity and mortality for children and adults \\nwith HIV. This review included five trials on vitamin A supplementation in children and only three \\n(all in Africa) contributed data on all-cause mortality. The data suggest that periodic vitamin A \\nsupplementation of HIV-infected children over six months of age is beneficial in reducing overall \\nmortality risk.\\nActions to promote vitamin A supplementation for children\\nIn 1997, WHO recommended universal vitamin A distribution, involving periodic administration \\nof supplemental doses to all preschool-age children, with priority given to age groups (usually six \\nmonths to three years) or regions at greatest risk of VAD, xerophthalmia, and nutritional blindness \\n(81).\\nVitamin A supplements should be delivered to children 6–59 months of age twice yearly, during \\nhealth system contacts. Where appropriate, supplements should be integrated into other \\npublic health programmes aimed at improving child survival, such as polio or measles national \\nimmunization days, or biannual child health days delivering a package of interventions such as \\ndeworming, distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and immunizations ( 82).

As a result, measles \\naccounts for a large proportion of preventable childhood blindness, particularly in Africa.\\nThe beneficial impact of two doses of vitamin A during treatment of measles is well established. \\nWHO’s current policy advocates administering vitamin A to all acute cases. A high dose of vitamin \\nA is given immediately on diagnosis and repeated the next day.\\nEven in countries where measles is not usually severe, vitamin A should be given to all cases of \\nsevere measles.\\n2.6 Daily iron supplementation for children 6 to 23 months old\\nWHO RECOMMENDATION\\nInfants have higher iron requirements in comparison with other age groups because \\nthey grow very rapidly. They are normally born with good iron stores. However, beyond \\nsix months of age the iron content of milk is not sufficient to meet many infants’ \\nrequirements, and unfortified complementary foods are usually low in iron, making this \\nage group susceptible to iron deficiency. LBW infants are born with fewer iron stores \\nand thus are at higher risk of developing iron deficiency at a younger age. Where the diet \\ndoes not include fortified foods, or prevalence of anaemia in children at approximately \\n1 year of age is severe (above 40%), supplements of iron at a dosage of 2 mg/kg of body \\nweight per day should be given to all children between 6 and 23 months of age.

A \\ntotal of 23 randomized controlled trials were included in the review that compared providing iron \\nsupplements to either no intervention, receiving a placebo or daily iron supplementation with the \\nsame nutrients among children living in various geographical settings, including malaria-endemic \\nregions.

Every year more than one million children under five years of age succumb to the \\nfluid loss and dehydration associated with the majority of diarrhoea-related deaths. It is estimated \\nthat 13% of all years lost due to ill-health, disability, or early death are caused by diarrhoea ( 101, \\n102, 103, 104).\\nOral rehydration is a well-known and relatively simple treatment approach (105, 106, 107, 108, 109, \\n110, 111). Oral rehydration salts (ORS), and particularly the low osmolarity formula, are a proven \\nlife-saving commodity for the treatment of children with diarrhoea. Use of zinc supplements with \\nORS to treat children with diarrhoea reduces deaths in children less than five years of age ( 112). \\nZinc for the treatment of diarrhoea reduces diarrhoea mortality by 23% ( 113) and is associated \\nwith a 14–15% reduction in incidence of pneumonia or diarrhoea (114). Use of zinc supplements \\nhas been found to reduce the duration and severity of diarrhoeal episodes and the likelihood of \\nsubsequent infections for two to three months (115, 116 , 117, 118). At the recommended dose zinc \\nsupplements are generally accepted by both children and caregivers and are effective regardless \\nof the type of zinc salt used ( 119, 120). Supplementary zinc benefits children with diarrhoea \\nbecause it is a vital micronutrient essential for protein synthesis, cell growth and differentiation, \\nimmune function and intestinal transport of water and electrolytes ( 121, 122, 123, 124). Zinc is \\nan essential micronutrient and protects cell membranes from oxidative damage ( 125). It is also \\nimportant for normal growth and development of children both with and without diarrhoea ( 126, \\n127, 128). Zinc deficiency is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal infections, \\nadverse effects on the structure and function of the gastrointestinal tract, and impaired immune \\nfunction (125, 129, 130, 131). Dietary deficiency of zinc is especially common in lower-income \\ncountries because of a low dietary intake of zinc-rich foods (mainly foods of animal origin) or \\ninadequate absorption caused by its binding to dietary fibre and phytates often found in cereals, \\nnuts and legumes (132, 133). \\nActions to promote use of zinc as part of diarrhoea treatment (134)\\nPolicy issues will need to be resolved in order to remove barriers to scaling-up.

These children have a higher weight gain when \\nreceiving a therapeutic diet compared to other diets, which results in faster recovery. There are \\nno known risks or negative effects associated with therapeutic feeding of these children applying \\nrecommended protocols and appropriate therapeutic foods. \\nWHO standards for MUAC-for-age show that in a well-nourished population there are very few \\nchildren aged 6–60 months with a MUAC less than 115 mm. Children with a MUAC less than 115 \\nmm have a highly elevated risk of death compared to those who are above.\\nWHO RECOMMENDATION FOR OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT \\nOF CHILDREN WITH SAM\\nChildren 6 months or older with SAM, appetite and no medical complications can be \\nmanaged in the community with regular visits to a health centre. ( 138, 139)\\nRationale and evidence \\nNew evidence suggests that large numbers of children with SAM can be treated in their commu -\\nnities without being admitted to a health facility or a therapeutic feeding centre.\\nThe community-based approach involves timely detection of SAM in the community and provision \\nof treatment for those without medical complications with ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF) \\nor other nutrient-dense foods at home and regular medical monitoring at a health facility. If \\nproperly combined with a facility-based approach for those malnourished children with medical \\ncomplications or below six months of age and implemented on a large scale, community-based \\nmanagement of SAM could prevent the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children ( 139). \\nSAM in children can be identified in the community before the onset of complications by CHWs \\nor volunteers using simple coloured plastic strips that are designed to measure MUAC. They can \\nalso be trained to recognize bilateral oedema of the feet, another sign of this condition.\\nUncomplicated forms of SAM should be treated in the community using an RUTF until adequate \\nweight has been gained. In some settings it may be possible to construct an appropriate therapeutic \\ndiet using locally available nutrient-dense foods with added micronutrient supplements. In addition \\nto the provision of RUTF, children need to receive a short course of basic oral medication to treat \\ninfections and need to be regularly monitored for danger signs of deterioration ( 140).'),\n",

RUTF are soft or crushable foods that can be consumed easily by \\nchildren from the age of six months. RUTF have a similar nutrient composition to F100, which is \\nthe therapeutic diet used in hospital settings, except for its iron content. Unlike F100, RUTF are \\nnot water-based, meaning that bacteria cannot grow in them. Therefore these foods can be used \\nsafely at home without refrigeration, even in areas where hygiene conditions are not optimal. As \\na result, more opportunities now exist for severely malnourished children to be discharged early \\nfrom hospital for continuing care in the community.\\nEvidence shows that RUTF home/outpatient therapy is successful ( 141, 142, 143), and that the \\nproduction of RUTF spreads is easy and safe in most settings worldwide ( 144). For this reason, \\nWHO developed international standards for the manufacturing of RUTF which give guidance for \\nlocal production; these include detailed nutrition composition and safety measures.\\nWHO RECOMMENDATION FOR INPATIENT MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN \\nWITH SAM\\nChildren 6 months or older with SAM, no appetite or with medical complications should \\nbe hospitalized for inpatient management ( 138).\\nRationale and evidence\\nWhile the figures on SAM show worrying trends, the implementation of the developed WHO \\nprotocol for facility-based management of SAM has improved the quality of hospital care.\\nThe establishment of community-based management of severe malnutrition within routine health \\nsystems is strongly justified in the literature. Indeed, malnourished children, their families and health \\nsystems could benefit from this type of management. When treated in the community, children \\nare less at risk of acquiring hospital infections. Family members caring for the malnourished child \\ncan spend less time away from home, and thus the opportunity cost of treatment is reduced. \\nHealth systems could reduce costs since hospitals would admit fewer cases and keep them for \\nshorter stays, and potentially increase coverage rates ( 145, 146, 147). Evidence suggests that \\nwith capacity built for inpatient, outpatient care and follow-up after discharge, case fatality rates \\ncan be as low as 5%, both in the community and in health facilities. \\nThe implementation of the WHO guidelines has the potential to save many of the lives currently \\nbeing lost through severe malnutrition and to contribute substantially to achieving the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goal of reducing child mortality.\\nActions for appropriate inpatient management of children with SAM\\nAppropriate therapy \\nA manual was developed by WHO in 1999 (148) to provide practical guidelines for the manage -\\nment of patients – mainly children below five years of age – with severe malnutrition in hospitals \\nand health centres. 1 It seeks to promote the best available therapy so as to reduce the risk of \\ndeath, shorten the length of time spent in hospital, and facilitate rehabilitation and full recovery. \\nThe management of the child with severe malnutrition is divided into four phases:\\n■■ Stabilization phase: for children with SAM and medical complications, life-threatening problems \\nare identified and treated in a hospital or a residential care facility, specific deficiencies are \\ncorrected, metabolic abnormalities are reversed and therapeutic feeding is begun (F75). 2 The \\nprotocol includes treatment of hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, dehydration with or without septic \\nshock, and severe anaemia, as well as the correction of electrolyte imbalances, treatment of \\ninfection and the correction of micronutrient deficiencies (while excluding iron). 3\\n1 This manual is currently being updated.\\n2 A special formula for treatment of malnourished children (as is F100).\\n3 Iron may be dangerous because transferrin levels are reduced and can become toxic because of reduced capacity \\nof the liver to metabolize.'),\n",

As a result, \\nthe development and implementation of guidelines on how best to offer nutritional care to HIV-\\ninfected children has lagged. The delivery of such care has also been compromised by service \\nprovider’s heavy work burden and need for training, recurring staff losses and weakened health \\ncare systems in HIV-affected settings. \\nIn 2004 WHO commissioned a technical review of the nutritional requirements of adults and \\nchildren infected with HIV as an evidence-base for the development of nutritional care guidelines. \\nThese were presented at the WHO technical consultation on Nutrition and HIV/Acquired \\nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) held in Durban in April 2005, where participants called \\nfor urgent action to “ Develop practical nutrition assessment tools and guidelines for home, \\ncommunity, health facility-based and emergency progammes ”.\\nHIV-infected children deserve special attention because of their additional needs to ensure \\ngrowth and development and their dependency on adults for adequate care, including nutrition \\ncare and support for treatment.

In exceptionally difficult circumstances, the focus needs to be on creating \\nconditions that will facilitate breastfeeding, such as establishing safe ‘corners’ for \\nmothers and infants, one-to-one counselling and mother-to-mother support. Traumatized \\nand depressed women may have difficulty responding to their infants and require \\nparticular mental and emotional support. Every effort should be made to identify ways to \\nbreastfeed infants and young children who are separated from their mothers. Breast-milk \\nsubstitutes, milk products, bottles and teats should never be part of a general or blanket \\ndistribution. Dried milk products should be distributed only when pre-mixed with a milled \\nstaple food and should not be distributed as a single commodity. A general food basket \\nshould provide 2100 kcal per person per day and include products fortified with vitamins \\nand minerals. Special focus should also be on early identification and management of \\ninfants and children with acute malnutrition to prevent serious illness and death ( 152, \\n153).\\nRationale and evidence\\nDisruption and displacement of populations in emergency situations greatly impacts on the \\nhealth and nutrition status of infants and young children. Adequate nutrition and care of children \\nhas been identified as one of the key factors to promote child health and stability. Malnutrition \\nis a major threat to child survival during an emergency and for those who survive; it can also \\nhave tremendous consequences on their cognitive, social, motor skill, physical and emotional \\ndevelopment. The best way to prevent malnutrition is to ensure optimal feeding and care for \\nchildren. In the emergency context, displaced or devastated communities are often dependent on \\nthe provision of food aid to meet their basic nutritional requirements. When food aid is provided, \\nissues around food handling, preparation and storage are highlighted because the normal food \\nsystems, including cooking facilities and access to fuel and water, are often disrupted and yet \\nfood must continue to be prepared and eaten. \\nDuring emergencies, the risk of diarrhoea is exacerbated ( 154) and transmission rates soar. \\nPoor access to clean water, poor food hygiene practices, introduction to new or unusual foods,'),\n",

Without proper food support, body \\nreserves of vitamin A become severely depleted. In the emergency context, there is an increase \\nin communicable and infectious diseases due to over-crowded shelter conditions and disruption \\ndue to population displacement and the demise of health infrastructure. Transmission of illnesses \\nsuch as diarrhoea, measles and pneumonia are exacerbated and lead to increased childhood \\nmortality. Measles is especially common in emergencies and can trigger acute malnutrition and \\naggravate VAD to dangerous levels.\\nAcute malnutrition needs to be addressed in the emergency context both to support a child’s \\nright to sufficient food, growth and well-being and to prevent more serious illness and death \\n(138, 139, 152). From a cost perspective per child, moderate malnutrition is significantly cheaper \\nto treat than severe malnutrition. Additionally, in emergencies there is generally disruption of \\naccess to basic food needs, health services and water and sanitation, and the effects will be \\nfelt more quickly and may have a more deleterious impact on families affected by HIV and AIDS \\n(152). Emergencies can also provoke and aggravate cases of chronic or acute malnutrition and \\nmicronutrient deficiencies through the impact they have on psychosocial well-being ( 154). \\nIn emergency situations there is an increased risk of death among the affected population and \\nin particular among vulnerable groups, such as orphans, children and pregnant and lactating \\nwomen. Needs of these groups must be taken into consideration to undertake effective nutrition \\nprogramming. \\nActions for appropriate infant and young child feeding in emergencies ( 155)\\nEarly emergency response \\nThe infant feeding in emergencies (IFE) operational guidance gives full details on IFE \\nimplementation. In the first few days of an emergency, immediate links with other sectors should \\nbe established, such as with reproductive health to provide ‘safe havens’ for pregnant and \\nlactating women. These ‘safe havens’ should be easily-accessible areas where privacy, security \\nand shelter are provided with access to water and food. Basic supportive care of breastfeeding \\nmothers and their infants can be offered and peer-to-peer support nurtured. \\nMinimum level of response \\nA minimum response to support IFE is indicated in all emergencies. This should include \\nnutritional adequacy and suitability of the general food ration for older infants and young children; \\nconsideration of supplementary feeding of pregnant and lactating women; ensuring and easing \\naccess to basic water and sanitation facilities, cooking, food and non-food items; ensuring rest \\nareas for populations in transit, including private areas for breastfeeding if culturally indicated; and \\nestablishing timely registration of newborns to support early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding. \\nPreventing and controlling micronutrient deficiencies: Multiple vitamin  \\nand mineral supplements \\nThe groups most vulnerable to micronutrient deficiencies are pregnant women, lactating women \\nand young children, mainly because they have a relatively greater need for vitamins and minerals \\nand are more susceptible to the harmful consequences of deficiencies.\\nWhen fortified rations are not being given, children aged 6 to 59 months should be given one \\ndose each day of the micronutrient supplement shown in Table I-7; when fortified rations are \\nbeing given, children aged 6 to 59 months should be given two doses each week of the same \\nmicronutrient supplement.'),\n",

The multiple micronutrient supplements should be given until the emergency is over and \\naccess to nutrient-rich foods is restored. \\nArtificial feeding in emergencies \\nAny support of artificial feeding in an emergency should be based on a needs assessment by \\nskilled technical staff, including a risk analysis.

Despite its proven \\nefficacy, supply and distribution of daily systems can be costly and logistically complicated. Lack \\nof supply of affordable supplements may limit the success of many supplementation programmes \\n(161, 162, 163). Another challenge is the occurrence of mild side effects, such as darkened \\nstools, gastrointestinal pain, diarrhoea, constipation and vomiting ( 69). \\nIntermittent supplementation, though not eliminating side effects, reduces their frequency and \\npossibly their severity compared to daily supplementation ( 68, 164, 165, 166, 167). Intermittent \\niron supplementation is the provision of iron supplements once, twice or three times a week \\non non-consecutive days ( 168). The rationale behind the intervention is that there is a limit to \\nthe iron absorption capacity of the intestine. Intermittent dosing may be as effective as daily \\nsupplementation because similar amounts of iron would reach the blood and tissues under both \\nstrategies (169, 170, 171). Intermittent supplementation has been shown to improve iron status \\nmore than no supplementation and, in many cases, it is as effective at improving iron status as \\ndaily supplementation (172, 173). \\nA Cochrane systematic review assessed the evidence behind the benefits and safety of \\nintermittent iron supplementation on anaemia and other health outcomes ( 168). The review \\ncompared the intermittent use of iron supplements alone, or in combination with folic acid or \\nother micronutrients, versus no intervention or placebo, and versus the same supplements given \\ndaily to women after menarche. The results showed that women who were taking intermittent iron \\nsupplements, alone or combined with other micronutrients, had higher haemoglobin and ferritin \\nconcentrations and were less likely to develop anaemia than those not receiving the supplement.'),\n",

This is because vitamin A is important \\nfor cell division, fetal organ and skeletal growth and maturation, maintenance of the immune \\nsystem to strengthen defences against infections, and development of vision in the fetus as well \\nas maintenance of maternal eye health and night vision. Thus, there is an increased need for \\nvitamin A during pregnancy, although the additional amount required is small and the increased \\nrequirement is limited to the third trimester.

In pre-eclampsia there are often problems with the \\nplacenta, along with increased blood pressure, that can reduce blood flow and therefore oxygen \\nand nutrient supply to the baby. These conditions may result in intra-uterine growth retardation \\nand possibly early delivery. Especially in lower-income settings, hypertensive disorders are the \\nleading cause of infant mortality ( 191). Pre-eclampsia may also cause serious outcomes for the \\nmother, such as kidney and liver problems, even progressing to stroke or seizures (eclampsia) \\nif not treated. Hypertensive disorders such as pre-eclampsia are thought to account for up to \\n40 000 maternal deaths per year. \\nMost women are monitored for increasing blood pressure during antenatal visits. Preventive \\nmeasures may assist in the prevention of prenatal complications and adverse outcomes for \\nwomen at increased risk of hypertensive disorders, such as those with multiple pregnancies, \\nolder age or increased BMI ( 192).

Recent studies have supported this \\nhypothesis, although there have been some inconsistencies in the strength and public health \\napplications of the associations (198, 199). In addition, the possible biological actions of prenatal \\ncalcium supplementation are not completely understood. \\nCalcium is an essential mineral that assists with many of the body’s processes, such as maintaining \\ncell membranes in nerve as well as muscle contraction ( 200). Low calcium intake is thought to \\ncause high blood pressure by increasing the amount of calcium released in the cells of blood \\nvessels, possibly leading to the constriction of these tissues. By supplementing with calcium \\nduring pregnancy, the amount of cellular calcium released is lessened, as is smooth muscle \\ntissue contractility. These mechanisms could prevent preterm labour and delivery by reducing \\nuterine muscle contractions, and perhaps improving utero-placental blood flow ( 201). \\nDuring pregnancy and lactation calcium supplementation is often recommended to meet the \\nbody’s demands to benefit the overall health of mother and child. Dietary reference intakes \\nfor pregnant women range from 1000 to 1300 mg per day, according to age group, with an \\nupper limit set at 2500 mg/day ( 202). Although providing extra calcium supplements to prevent \\nhypertensive disorders is relatively inexpensive and accessible, large doses of > 500 mg/day are \\nless efficiently absorbed and may inhibit the absorption of other necessary micronutrients such \\nas iron, zinc, magnesium and phosphorus ( 203, 204). \\nAccording to a recent Cochrane systematic review, supplementation with at least 1 g of calcium \\nis associated with significantly lower risk of pregnant women developing pre-eclampsia and \\npreterm birth among women with low calcium intakes. However, the public health implications \\nfor this intervention are not completely clear. Another recent study determined that calcium \\nsupplementation in pregnant women with low calcium intakes may not necessarily benefit \\nmaternal bone health ( 205). Conflicting evidence exists on the benefits of maternal calcium \\nsupplementation on the blood pressure of their offspring ( 206, 207, 208). \\nIn summary, as indicated in the most recent WHO guidelines, there is clear evidence to show \\nthat daily supplementation with 1.5 to 2 g of elemental calcium is beneficial to reduce the risks of \\ngestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia and preterm birth ( 189).\\n4.5 Reaching optimal iodine nutrition in pregnant and lactating women \\nWHO RECOMMENDATION\\nWHO and UNICEF recommend iodine supplementation for pregnant and lactating women \\nin countries where less than 20% of households have access to iodized salt, until the salt \\niodization programme is scaled up.

If other \\nmass-fortification programmes with other food vehicles are implemented effectively, these suggested fortification \\nlevels may need to be adjusted downwards as needed.\\nb Estimated per capita consumption of <75 g/day does not allow for addition of sufficient level of fortificant to cover \\nmicronutrient needs for women of childbearing age. Fortification of additional food vehicles and other interventions \\nshould be considered.\\nc NR = Not Recommended because very high levels of electrolytic iron needed could negatively affect sensory \\nproperties of fortified flour.\\nd These amounts of zinc fortification assume 5 mg zinc intake and no additional phytate intake from other dietary \\nsources.\\nRationale and evidence\\nWheat and maize flour fortification should be considered when industrially-produced flour is \\nregularly consumed by large population groups in a country. Wheat and maize flour fortification \\nprogrammes are expected to be most effective in achieving a public health impact if mandated at \\nthe national level, and can help achieve international public health goals.\\nDecisions about which nutrients to add and the appropriate amounts to add to fortify flour should \\nbe based on a series of factors, including the nutritional needs and deficiencies of the population; \\nthe usual consumption profile of “fortifiable” flour (i.e. the total estimated amount of flour milled \\nby industrial roller mills, produced domestically or imported, which could in principle be fortified); \\nsensory and physical effects of the fortificant nutrients on flour and flour products; fortification \\nof other food vehicles; population consumption of vitamin and mineral supplements; and costs.'),\n",

The evolution of evidence for the \\neffects of nutrition interventions, \\n1960 –2010\\nSystematic scientific studies of the nature and causes of malnutrition in children and mothers \\nin low-income societies were brought into early focus by Scrimshaw and colleagues ( 1), based \\nlargely on work in Central America. A number of prospective studies, of which one of the most \\ninfluential was conducted in Narangwal, India ( 2), established that nutrition interventions were \\nefficacious in contributing to child health, survival, growth and development. The authors of a \\nsynthesis of ten such studies ( 3) concluded that health and nutrition interventions do have a \\npositive impact on children’s nutrition.\\nPrimary health care, as conceived at the Alma Ata conference (4), included nutrition interventions, \\nas did Child Survival programmes ( 5) and similar initiatives, as brought together at the World \\nSummit for Children ( 6). These interventions were bundled (e.g. UNICEF’s GOBI-FFF – growth \\nmonitoring, oral rehydration, breastfeeding, immunization, female education, family spacing and \\nfood supplements) and applied on a large scale, but evaluations of impact were scarce. The \\nevidence for designing effective programmes continued to be based primarily on the efficacy of \\nindividual interventions in experimental conditions. 1 A few large-scale programmes which started \\nin the 1980s, such as the Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Programme (TINP) supported by the \\nWorld Bank, and the Iringa Joint Nutrition Support Programme (JNSP), supported by UNICEF \\nand WHO, were carefully monitored, and the evidence continues to be relevant.\\nA considerable variety of interventions have been regarded as part of nutrition programmes (and \\nmany are also included in health-related programmes, such as the Integrated Management of \\nChildhood Illness – IMCI ( 7)). The content ranged from feeding programmes and behavioural \\nchange, to immunization and medical interventions. The scope of this review was set by \\nconsiderations of efficacy studies, and experience of programmes either defined as strictly \\nnutrition, or with substantial nutrition components or objectives. For example, the Lancet \\nnutrition series ( 8) evaluated 20 separately-defined interventions. As described in  Part I of \\nthis document, an independent but similar set of ENAs may be grouped as addressing general \\nnutrition, micronutrients and disease control. The main routes or platforms for interventions \\ntargeting mothers and young children are community based, usually linked to health facilities \\n(or government outreach activities), and/or campaigns such as child health days/weeks. Cash \\ntransfer programmes, conditional or unconditional (CCTs or CTs) have recently increased in \\ncoverage and importance in addressing health and nutrition problems; usually they constitute \\nprogrammes (or platforms) themselves, with conditionality linked to health, nutrition and education \\n(see later section).\\nEvidence for the impact of nutrition actions from experimental studies (i.e. efficacy trials) has \\nshown that child (and less often maternal) nutritional status can benefit from direct interventions \\n(9, 10, 11 ). However, scaling-up based on efficacy results requires caution, as operational \\nprogrammes have different conditions than efficacy trials, and priority should be given to evaluating \\neffectiveness under operational conditions. This approach requires alternative, rigorous methods, \\nbeyond randomized trials (12), that have so far rarely been applied and carried through.\\nWhile a number of large-scale programmes were undertaken starting in the 1970s (see Table \\nII-1), only a few included impact evaluation. Programme development continued without a solid \\nevidence base, both as large-scale investments from the World Bank (e.g. in Bangladesh, \\nMadagascar and Senegal), and as development of national programmes (e.g. in Thailand and \\nVietnam). The Thailand programme was developed after rejecting conventional externally-driven \\n1 Effectiveness refers to estimated changes in outcome (e.g. child nutritional status) in large-scale operational \\nprogrammes; and efficacy to changes in outcome estimated to be attributable to the intervention under controlled \\nconditions.'),\n",

The drive to proceed in the relative absence of positive evaluation results was widely \\nnoted, for example by Save the Children-UK ( 14). (This programme is discussed later.) \\nEvaluations and assessments of operational programmes gradually built up from findings from \\nlarge-scale programmes as they expanded from the 1980s on. Based on this development, \\nsome 61 projects, mostly large scale, have been reviewed (see Table II-1), representing most \\nof the programmes considered relevant over about the last 30 years. Some of the early projects, \\nsuch as the Narangwal study, tended towards efficacy trials, and they provide a basis for later \\nwork. Reviews by Gwatkin and colleagues ( 3) and Berg ( 15) drew on the same projects, and \\nwere significant in catalysing the expansion of large-scale programmes starting in the 1980s \\n(16). Eleven commissioned country case studies provided additional information ( 17). A regional \\nplanning project sponsored by the Asian Development Bank and UNICEF assessed programmes \\nin seven Asian countries ( 18, 19 ). An assessment of nutritional trends associated with nine \\nprogrammes (20) was carried out as part of the Combating malnutrition: time to act study  (21), \\nwhich included four in-depth country investigations. The review was extended to include estimates \\nof resources (intensity, as resources/head per year), coverage, outcomes and other key factors, \\nfor 15 programmes (22). A World Bank report ( 23), quoting many of the projects listed in Table \\nII-1, referred to “short routes to improving nutrition”, meaning direct interventions as opposed to \\nchanging context (e.g. education, income).\\nThe Lancet nutrition series ( 11) contains many of the efficacy results reported in Part I, as well \\nas drawing on a number of the same set of established large-scale projects in Table II-1 (24). \\nNonetheless, the paucity of rigorous effectiveness evaluations of large-scale programmes was \\nhighlighted by the comprehensive Lancet exercise. The World Bank sponsored re-evaluation \\nin at least two cases – for Bangladesh ( 25) and Madagascar ( 26), as well as an evaluation of \\ntheir Senegal programme ( 27). The Independent Evaluation Group published a synthesis of 28 \\nevaluations (some large-scale, some experimental) ( 28). This review failed to elicit a clear pattern \\nof activities linked to impact. However, it did not include estimates of intensity of resource use, \\nwhich is likely to account for some differences. It acknowledged the likely impact of a number \\nof the programmes reviewed, and where feasible estimated effect sizes. (This relation between \\ninput levels – ‘intensity’ – and size of effect has been rarely examined until recently.)\\nSeveral external agencies, such as the World Bank, the United States Agency for International \\nDevelopment, the Swedish International Development Agency and UNICEF supported these \\nprogrammes. The reviews that synthesized these experiences ( Table II-1 ) relied mainly on \\nimplementation and management aspects, since few evaluation data were available.'),\n",

What do we need to know? \\nThe actual impact in large-scale operational, multi-component programmes depends not just \\non the efficacy (hence, potential impact) of individual interventions, e.g. counselling on feeding \\npractices. It also depends on the means by which these are provided (platforms or routes), the \\nresource use, the context, and the interactions with other activities and factors. Without these it \\nis difficult to interpret diverse results, as noted above ( 28). Not just interventions, but the routes \\nby which people participate need consideration.\\nThe evidence from large-scale programmes should be combined with efficacy to reach \\ngeneralizable conclusions concerning the evidence and its interpretation, as well as its application \\nto possible designs and resourcing of strengthened, scaled-up or new programmes intended to \\naccelerate improvement of nutrition in children and women in low- and middle-income countries. \\nDirect estimation of impact from some form of randomized assignment to treatment groups has \\nvirtually never proved feasible in national or large-scale programmes. Estimates of effectiveness \\nat this scale depend on evaluation designs that attempt to extract likely net change attributable \\nto an intervention by a variety of methods, often described as quasi-experimental (including \\nnatural experiments). Probably the only near-national programme that deliberately assigned the \\npopulation to treatment or comparison groups was the Progresa/Oportunidades  programme in \\nMexico (29).\\nThe development over time of large-scale maternal and child nutrition programmes (e.g. as \\nmeasured by growth or BMI) was significantly interrupted by a move towards micronutrient \\nprogrammes, which were largely run outside mainstream maternal and child activities. For \\ninstance, iodized salt was usually a separate programme, and VAD was mainly addressed \\nthrough intermittent high dose capsule distribution in child health campaigns and/or immunization \\nactivities. Iron supplementation was linked to regular programmes, but generally has not achieved \\nmuch outreach or impact. In the last decade, priorities have moved towards a more balanced and \\nintegrated approach. However, the data available on large-scale programmes cannot distinguish \\npossible effects of different components on general nutrition (measured by anthropometry), \\nalthough in principle micronutrient effects could be estimated when there are data (e.g. for \\nanaemia).\\nProgrammes should not be seen as simply an additive combination of single components (or \\nseparate interventions). Very often, multiple interventions can be expected to modify each other’s \\neffects.1 Resources may not be additive: once a system is working, the mix of interventions can be \\nflexible, and the marginal costs of adding activities lowered (within reason, without overwhelming \\nthe front-line worker). Key questions – of resource intensity and programme quality, coverage, \\ncontext, and platforms or routes by which individuals are in contact with overall combined \\nprogramme activities – are only recently being estimated as crucial determinants of outcome (22, \\n23, 24). This part of the document aims to stress the effectiveness of multi-component, large-\\nscale, operational programmes, and to be useful for decisions on policies and programmes; in \\nfact, the evaluation results appear adequate to contribute to such decisions (see Habicht and \\ncolleagues (30) on matching evaluation designs to decision needs).\\n1 These interactions can be either direction: as examples, controlling diarrhoea would be expected to make feeding \\nprogrammes more effective; measles immunization would lead to vitamin A supplements having less impact on \\nmeasles mortality.'),\n",

The impact on whom is being \\nestimated? \\nThe aim of this work is to provide evidence for attribution of changes in nutritional outcomes to \\nprogramme activities. For this, it is necessary to define precisely whose nutritional outcome is \\nbeing assessed, that is, whether the outcome refers to the participants or to the overall population \\n(by age, sex, etc.). The initial rate of improvement appears to be much faster than the sustained \\nrate, and this initial rate needs to be distinguished from the sustained rate to see consistent \\nresults. Typically the initial rate is about 5–10 percentage points change in underweight (ppt)/\\nyear, over a limited period (probably several months), and the sustained rate is then 1–2 ppt/year. \\nA typical underlying (no programme) improving trend is around -0.5 ppt/year (e.g. starting at \\n40%, reducing to 35% in a decade).\\nFour rates may be measured:\\n(1) Participants’ initial rate (usually obtained from weighing data);\\n(2) Participants’ sustained rate;\\n(3) Population initial rate;1\\n(4) Population sustained rate (e.g. from population-based evaluation surveys; related to \\nparticipants’ rate by coverage, although participants may change, coming in and out of the \\nprogramme). This is the indicator used in Figures II-1 and II-2, discussed later.\\nThe effect size can be measured as rates of change – e.g. ppt/year – or as before-after (one \\ntime) changes. Rate is used for programmes which are not usually intended to have a one-time \\nimpact but to keep going until the intended outcome reaches a norm or goal. 2 Efficacy results \\nusually refer to particular groups of participants (e.g. during pregnancy; 12–24 months old), and \\nare not always translated into expected effects in terms of population prevalence reductions (i.e. \\nrates of improvement in the population). Victora and colleagues ( 12) have discussed in detail the \\ndifferences expected between efficacy rates and those from routine programmes. The Lancet \\nseries reported simulations for coverages, giving the outputs as mortality, stunting and disability-\\nadjusted life years ( 11). Rates are used as the outcome for effectiveness, and effect sizes given \\nas ppt/year. \\n1 Usually not reported – population-based surveys are seldom carried out early in programmes.\\n2 Objectives are often stated as, for example, reducing underweight in preschool children by 25% over five years. \\nNote that this translates into ppt/year using the starting prevalence; if this is (say) 40%, then the objective is to \\nreach 30% in 5 years, which is 10/5 ppt/year, = 2 ppt/year.'),\n",

Shape of response curve\\nTwo important non-linear effects should be distinguished. First, the observation noted above \\nthat the initial rate of reduction in malnutrition among participants, soon after the programme is \\nlaunched, tends to be much more rapid than the sustained rate; thus, the prevalence curve is \\nsteep and then flattens. The reasons are not well established, but it seems likely that a vulnerable \\npart of the population – for example, those currently ill – may respond quickly to care and \\nmedical attention, and improve rapidly. The causes of current underweight may be different for \\nother segments of the population – for example, feeding practices or food insecurity – and they \\nmay improve less rapidly. It is the sustained rate that will eventually bring long-term nutrition \\nimprovement. What happens to the initial improvement if the programme is discontinued is not \\nknown, but it seems likely that it would deteriorate again. The estimated sustained rate at the \\npopulation level is used as the main indicator.\\nSecond, a non-linear dose-response type of relation between improvement rates (among \\nparticipants) and resources applied is expected. This has long been postulated ( 31), and a rule \\nsuggested that US$ 5–US$ 10/head per year is needed to bring an additional 1–2 ppt/year \\nimprovement in underweight (17). Below this a less-than-proportional effect is seen – a threshold \\nlevel must be reached before improvement starts. (A corollary is that spending too little per \\nparticipant does not just solve the problem more slowly, but does not solve it at all, and wastes \\nresources.) Until now not enough data have been available to examine this empirically. However, \\ncommunity health/nutrition worker (CHNW) numbers (e.g. CHNWs per 1000 households) give \\na useful measure of intensity and allow estimation of what resources are needed to achieve an \\neffect.\\nIn sum, one aim is to assess what types of operational programmes – multi-component, through \\ndifferent platforms – bring about a sustained reduction in child underweight among participants, \\nand what level of resources is needed. Of the 60-plus country programmes identified (see Table \\nII-1), 21 are reviewed here, and data were extracted from 11 that appeared to give reasonable \\nestimates of both nutrition improvements and resource uses, as shown in Figures II-1 and II-2.'),\n",

Estimating nutrition  \\nimprovement achieved and \\nassociated resources\\n6.1 Data sources and calculations\\nAs indicated previously, about 60 programmes, mostly large-scale, were identified, almost all \\nfrom previous reviews as listed in Table II-1. Of these, 21 were reviewed in detail, and for 11 \\nprogrammes, sufficient data on both outcome (underweight,1 ppt/year) and intensity of resources \\n(CHNWs per 1000 households, 2 and US$/household per year) were identified and further \\nreviewed to explore associations. Initial identification of these programmes was by country; within \\ncountries, data on individual programmes were then investigated further. For each country and \\nprogramme, the estimates for reduction in underweight and resource intensity were made from \\navailable materials.\\nThe intensity estimates were determined from project documents, reports, etc. (for further details, \\nsee Annex 3). CHNWs were classified as full or part-time. Based on informal enquiries (e.g. in \\nThailand), it was estimated that part-time CHNWs worked about one half-day per week, so that \\none full-time CHNW would be equivalent to ten part-time ones, except where indicated. The \\nfinances assigned to the programmes were taken from budget or expenditure reports, and are \\nvery approximate. They were divided by the child population covered to give US$/child per year. \\nThe figures are intended to estimate running costs, but in some cases part of start-up costs was \\nincluded. The sources of the results used are described below.\\nBangladesh. The Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Project (BINP) operated from 1995 to 2002 \\nwith approximate coverage by area of 15% (59/464 thanas). Intensity of CHNWs was reported \\nas 1:200 children ( 19), i.e. about 5:1000 households. Resource intensity was estimated at \\napproximately US$ 18/household per year, including supplementary feeding.\\nVarious evaluations of BINP’s nutritional impact were conducted by both internal and external \\nreviewers. The estimate used of BINP impact on child underweight 3 was derived from a theory-\\nbased impact evaluation of the project in which a combination of data from previous evaluations \\nwas used (33, 34). This latter evaluation reported an overall 2.0 ppt reduction in underweight due \\nto BINP activities, i.e. 0.3 ppt/yr. \\nSubsequent activities led into the National Nutrition Programme (NNP), 2004–2007, whose \\nintended coverage was 105/464 thanas. This programme had implementation problems; the \\nbaseline survey was delayed and the end survey never conducted ( 35). Thus, no estimate of \\neffect is available.\\nSupport for nutrition activities became absorbed into the Health and Nutrition Population Sector \\nProgramme (HNPSP), 2007–2010 (25% nutrition and food security; about US$ 4 300 m in \\nfunding, 37% external). HNPSP has no available evaluation data, and disbursement (as of July \\n2010) was about 5%, so was clearly slow in starting ( 35).\\nEthiopia. The Community Based Nutrition Programme (CBN), as part of the National Nutrition \\nProgramme, was initiated in 2008 and continues today ( 36). Population coverage in target \\nareas (now approximately 250/640 woredas (districts)) is approximately 40% and intensity of \\nCHWs is about 1:23 children, estimated as 0.2 FTEs, i.e. 86:1000 households (37). Estimates of \\nreduction in underweight from the CBN programme are preliminary, derived from an initial analysis \\n1 As far as possible, the age group for which these estimates were made was 0–5 years; no adjustment was made if \\nonly other age groups were reported (e.g. 0–3 years).\\n2 While most CHNWs are part-time, in some projects full-time CHNWs are hired. Part-time CHNWs were calculated \\nas 0.1 full-time equivalents (FTEs).\\n3 Early estimates of initial reduction in underweight among participants were rapid, for severe malnutrition 13.8% \\nto 2.9% from April to November 1997 ( 32). UNICEF unpublished figures showed underweight in participants \\nchanged from 79% to 66% from April 1997 to March 1998 ( 20, Figure 2e.)'),\n",

The Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Programme I (TINP I) was implemented from 1980 \\nto 1989 with approximately 46% coverage by area (173/373 rural blocks in 11 districts). CHW \\nintensity for TINP I was reported as 1:150 households ( 38), or 40:1000 households. Resource \\nintensity of TINP I was previously estimated at US$ 9.50/household per year ( 38). Reduction in \\nunderweight in TINP areas was approximately 1.4 ppt/year ( 38) or 1.5 ppt/year (39). \\nThe Tamil Integrated Nutrition Programme II (TINP II) ran from 1990–1997, and coverage was \\napproximately 80% by area (316/385 rural blocks). TINP II intensity of CHWs and resources was \\nthe same as TINP I ( 22). The sustained rate of reduction in population underweight attributed to \\nTINP II was 1.1 ppt/year (40). \\nThe Integrated Child Development Services Project I (ICDS I) was supported by the World \\nBank and other donors from 1990-1997, with population coverage of approximately 2.5% ( 41). \\nThe intensity of CHNWs, known as Anganwadi workers (ANWs) (estimated at 20% FTE) was \\n1:1000 persons, i.e. approximately 1:200 children ( 19) or 10:1000 households. While there \\nare no definitive evaluations, most reports on ICDS 1 estimate that the change in underweight \\nattributable to the programme was slight ( 41, 42); the rate is plotted as 0.2 ppt/year.\\nIndonesia. The Family Nutrition Improvement programme (UPGK), also known as the Posyandu \\n(weighing post) programme, started around 1979 and expanded to national coverage, continuing \\nuntil constrained by an economic crisis in the late 1990s. From 1975–1990 coverage was \\napproximately 90% by area (58 000/65 000 villages) ( 22, 43, 44 ). The number of children per \\nposyandu was about 60.1 Rohde (45) refers to five CHNWs per posyandu, nearly one million in \\ntotal. However, they had limited training (3 days) and high turnover, and on evaluation only a small \\npercentage was able to provide meaningful counselling. At 4 CHNWs per posyandu, this gives \\n66 CHNWs/1000.\\nRecurrent costs, which may be seen as those needed for sustained activities, were estimated \\nat approximately US$ 1/household per year ( 45), but this figure may not include all local costs. \\nThe reduction in underweight ascribed to UPGK activities based on previous research was \\napproximately 1.0 ppt/year (22). \\nMadagascar. The Second Community Nutrition Project (SEECALINE) was supported by the \\nWorld Bank and others from 1999–2003; coverage was approximately 50% by area (56/111 \\ndistricts) ( 46). SEECALINE intensity of CHWs was estimated as 1:125 households to 1:225 \\nhouseholds (21, 47), or 60:1000 households. Resource intensity for the project was estimated at \\nUS$ 10/household per year based on project documents (21). The rate of underweight reduction \\nwas reported as 0.86-1.25 ppts/year ( 47), or approximately 1.1 ppt/year for the population \\nsustained rate. \\nSenegal. The Community Nutrition Program (CNP) operated from 1995–2001, with coverage of \\napproximately 20% of children under 3 years of age ( 48). Intensity of CHWs was about 1:124 \\nhouseholds ( 48), i.e. 80:1000 households. Approximately 98% of beneficiaries were reached, \\nand therefore the rate for participants is about equivalent to that of the population as a whole. \\nResource intensity of the CNP was approximately US$ 40/household per year based on 6 \\nmonths of participation for children ( 48).2 Estimated reduction in population underweight was \\n2.2 ppt/year (48).\\nTanzania.

The sustained \\nrate (1986–90) was 1.9 ppt/year (52) from the weighing programme, during which time coverage \\nwas around 90%; the rate in 1984–90 was 2.8 ppt/year. Using NCHS standards, the rate during \\n1987-95 was 1.5 ppt/year ( 53). Another report ( 54) gave underweight estimates of 40.6% for \\n1986 and 31.3% for 1995 using national standards, i.e. 1.0 ppt/year. The sustained population \\nrate during the programme was 2.0 ppt/year. \\nVietnam.

By 2005 an estimated 100 000 CHNWs \\n(nutrition collaborators) were in place for an intensity of approximately 1 CHNW per 70 households, \\ni.e. 75:1000 households. Resource intensity was about US$ 0.70/household per year, excluding \\ndistrict and commune costs. Reduction in underweight, as the population sustained rate, was \\nabout 1.5–2.0 ppt/year from 1994–1998 plotted as 1.8 ppt/year from repeated surveys and from \\n1999–2005 data from the weighing programme ( 55, 56). \\n6.2 Do levels of resources relate to rates of improvement?\\nEstimates of changes in preschool children’s underweight prevalences were calculated for \\n11 of the programmes examined (see last column of Table II-1) where both outcome results \\n(underweight change) and resources (intensity as CHNWs/1000, and US$/child per year) were \\navailable. \\nIn Figure II-1 the rate of underweight reduction (y-axis) is plotted with the CHNWs/1000 children, \\npart-time equivalents. The rate (y-axis) is probably more dependable than the intensity, although \\nboth are somewhat uncertain. Above about 30 CHNWs/1000 children there are improvements of \\n1–2 ppt/year. It has not been possible to extract the underlying (without programme) rate in most \\ncases; however, it would usually not be more than -0.5 ppt/year. \\nMost of the rate estimates are reasonably well known – Thailand and Vietnam are from national \\nprogrammes, Tanzania/Iringa and TINP have been widely reported and Bangladesh, Madagascar \\nand Senegal have been estimated by World Bank evaluators. The Ethiopia figure is from recent \\ndata and unpublished, but appears to be a fairly conservative estimate. The Indonesia rate \\nappears low; however, the financial data ( 45) (see Figure II-2 ) have been a long-standing low \\noutlier which may also explain the relatively low improvement rate.\\nFinancial data ( Figure II-1 ) seem to show little relation of effect with financial resources. At \\nthe lower end of resources the Vietnam figure does not include local costs, and (as above) the \\nIndonesia figure may be an underestimate.

Implications\\n7.1 Implications for programmes: limitations and caveats\\nThe role of individual interventions in improving child nutrition was discussed in Part I  of this \\ndocument. Efficacy in terms of, for example, counselling changing breastfeeding practices, is \\nwell understood. The impact of these changes on child health and development outcomes, while \\ncovered in fewer studies, is reasonably well established. Bhutta and colleagues ( 11) provide \\nan important synthesis as shown in Table II-2 . The issue addressed concerns the evidence \\nthat interventions, known to be efficacious individually, have an impact when incorporated into \\noperational large-scale programmes. \\nThe extended list of programmes in Table II-1 covers those that have been used for overviews in \\nthe past (up to 2010), with some newer ones identified and introduced for this review. Material \\nwas sought that described their content, with particular focus on quantitative measures of \\noutcome and of programme coverage and resources. Some characteristics of 32 programmes \\nwere extracted, and detailed case studies developed for 21 of these based on availability of \\ninformation (see Annex 3). Outcome evaluation data and resource estimates were considered \\nadequate for 11 of these (see Tables II-3 and II-4). The resource indicators chosen were (a) \\nCHNWs per 1000 participants (or CHNWs/1000 households) and (b) running expenditures as \\nUS$/household per year. The commonest outcome, underweight prevalence in children, was \\nestimated as a rate of change, as ppt/year. Assessing outcomes should distinguish initial rates \\nof improvement – now seen to be quite rapid – from the sustained rates (after a year or so); \\nand between programme participants and the overall child population. (These distinctions are \\nnot always made in reports.) The population sustained rate of improvement was estimated in \\ncomparing outcomes.\\nThe limited quality and number of the evaluation results for effectiveness of operational nutrition \\nprogrammes is widely recognized to be a major constraint. The approach to evaluation of operational \\nprogrammes is necessarily quite different to efficacy trials ( 12) and can rarely use randomization \\nto treatment and comparison groups. Other designs can be employed, and especially when \\nthese are prospective, can give plausible inferences on impact, usually requiring some advanced \\nanalyses. As Bhutta and colleagues ( 11) noted from their extensive literature search for meta-\\nanalyses, ”(of) evidence from effectiveness trials and programme assessments, fewer than 3% of \\nall interventions qualified” for inclusion. Virtually all their data were from trials, and the results refer \\nto efficacy. The quality of evidence on effectiveness is weaker, and permits including a number of \\nthe programmes excluded by Bhutta and colleagues. However, as described above, a number of \\nprogrammes have been evaluated (some re-evaluated, e.g. by the World Bank, from Bangladesh, \\nMadagascar and Senegal), and extracting the best estimates where data are available seems to \\ngive at least a plausible pattern, e.g. as shown in Figure II-1. Details of how the numbers were \\nobtained are given in the text above and in the case studies in Annex 3.\\nPrevious syntheses of evaluation results – including on efficacy – have not emphasized the key \\nfactors of coverage and resource intensity. Differences in resources (per capita) would be likely \\nto influence impact, and would account for part of the differences between impact observed \\nin large-scale programmes versus trials and pilot projects (where resources are normally less \\nconstrained). Thus particular attention has been paid to relating outcomes to resources. The \\nindicators that could be obtained, e.g. CHNWs/1000, do not reflect quality, training, incentives, \\nsupervision and other crucial factors which should be included in future studies. CHNWs/1000 \\nmay also be an available proxy indicator of broader programme effort.\\nThe programmes considered operate through CHNWs, based usually in community centres (with \\nhome visiting); the distribution of platforms is shown in Table II-3. Supervision is usually through \\nthe health system. The programmes have a reasonably common overall pattern of activities – \\ncounselling, micronutrients, etc. – but within these details vary, presumably with different \\nconditions and contexts.

At the \\nsame time, severe malnutrition also falls rapidly to low levels (e.g. 10% to 2%). This pattern was \\nseen in, for example, Bangladesh (early BNIP), Ethiopia, Senegal, Tanzania (Iringa), Thailand and \\nother places. The reasons for this initial response are not known, and are likely to be in part from \\ntreatment of diseases and immunization.\\nThe sustained rate, over a number of years, is what presumably makes a long-term difference. \\nAn expected dose-response is seen roughly in the sustained rate ( Figure II-1), measuring the \\nresources as CHNWs/1000 households (or children). The results suggest that a level of around \\n30 CHNWs/1000 (1 CHNW:33 children, estimated as part time, 0.1 FTEs) is needed for an \\nimprovement rate of 1 ppt/year or higher in underweight.\\nThe most important implication is that community-based nutrition programmes can be effective, \\nand that adequate resources – for example, enough CHNWs, trained and supported – must \\nbe put into these, and sustained over years, for them to provide a substantial impact on child \\nnutrition. For example, a with-programme improvement rate of 1.5 ppt/year is typical; current sub-\\nregional child underweight prevalences are 13%–23% in Africa, with change rates of 0.1 to -0.2 \\nppt/year; in Asia these figures are 18%–33%, with change rates of -0.3 to -1.0 ppt/year. A rate \\nof 1.5 ppt/year over 10 years reduces these prevalences by 15 ppt, i.e. to 0%–7% in Africa and \\n3%–18% in Asia (57). Thus, sustaining these activities at the required intensity for 10 years or so \\nwould substantially reduce child malnutrition, as has been seen in several countries with national \\nprogrammes (e.g. Thailand, Vietnam). 2\\nThe resources needed show no such relation ( Figure II-2 ), partly because of difficulties in \\nestimating financial resources. This finding may also reflect that it is how funds are used that \\ncounts: investing in local organizations, and especially appropriate training, support, and \\nincentives for community workers, are key.\\nThe precise details of the interventions (counselling, referral, micronutrients, etc.) may not be the \\nmost essential factor, although of course they must be relevant and appropriate to the context. \\nThe extent of contact between trained, familiar community workers and mothers with children \\nmay be more crucial. It could be argued that the impact comes not primarily from delivering \\nservices, but from fostering the collective efficacy of communities: mothers obtain more control \\nover their families’ health and survival, and increase their own effective efforts. 3 This is catalysed \\nand supported by the community-based programme structure.\\nThe question of interfacing with vertical programmes – child health days or weeks – was not \\nexplicitly studied here. Experience in six African countries ( 58, 59 ) indicates that there are \\nopportunity costs to child health days/weeks for community-based programmes (e.g. personnel \\n1 “Complementary foods” refers to those given from six months on to complement breastfeeding; it may in practice \\nrefer to children’s foods in the period between 6 and 23 months of age. Supplementary foods refer here to foods \\nprovided from outside of the household.\\n2 Countries that have experienced transitions at these rates are illustrated in ( 57), Figure 9 – some of which may be \\nattributable to nutrition programmes (but the data are insufficient to estimate how much).\\n3 This argument is elaborated on p. 1067 in ( 22). The huge commitments of their own scarce resources that poor \\nfamilies make to children’s education attest to the strong will to foster children’s welfare, when people know better \\nhow to do so.'),\n",

Cash Transfer Programmes\\nCash transfer programmes, conditional (on health/nutrition related actions: CCTs) or unconditional \\n(CTs) have expanded rapidly in recent years, and are of increasing importance for improving \\nnutrition. They are highly complementary to other nutrition actions, and involve establishing \\neligibility, usually based on low income. Hence, they are positively targeted towards the poor and \\nmost vulnerable. The level of resources/head is much higher than for typical nutrition programmes \\n– but the objectives are broader – and the scale in terms of coverage equal or higher. Their effect \\non nutrition is both through increasing resources (income), and, for conditional programmes, \\nenhancing use of services such as immunization and education. The impact on nutritional status \\nof children is potentially both through maternal nutrition and hence intra-uterine growth and \\ndevelopment, and through infant and young child feeding, care, and use of health services. \\nExamples of CCTs and CTs that have been described and evaluated to some extent were drawn \\nfrom the literature, agency reports, and other documents for this section. These sixteen case \\nstudies are described in Annex 3, and some characteristics summarized in Table II-5. CCTs are \\nthe usual form for these programmes in Latin America, where they have been operating for some \\ntime, while CTs are the norm in Africa.\\nCash transfer programmes provide assistance in the form of money in order to increase household \\nincome. Transfers may be given without requirements that household members meet specified \\nconditions, or be contingent upon compliance with a specified set of conditions. CCTs have \\nincreased in popularity in recent years due to their perceived ability to create long-term benefits \\nthrough encouraging behaviour adoption that improves well-being, and investing in human capital \\n(62). Provision of transfer is generally targeted to poor households. Programmes may directly \\naffect nutrition (e.g. providing supplements), or connect to nutrition outcomes less directly (e.g. \\nthrough increasing use of health services, antenatal care or education). Conditionalities may \\ninclude periodic health visits, growth monitoring, vaccination when applicable, antenatal care, \\nand attendance at education sessions by mothers ( 63).\\nBoth CTs and CCTs are forms of social assistance, or safety nets, assisting beneficiaries who are \\nvulnerable to impoverishment without support ( 62, 64 ). Public works programmes (productive \\nsafety nets) and in-kind transfers (food for work) are two other components of social safety nets \\nbut will not be described in detail here. Ethiopia’s PSNP is included as cash transfers are provided \\nto mothers. In sub-Saharan Africa overall approximately 137 programmes were in operation in \\n37 countries in 2009 ( 64). Transfer programmes in Latin American countries are mostly CCTs, \\nwhich have dramatically increased in popularity in comparison to CTs, as well as expanded to \\nother regions, in the past 10 years ( 63).\\nSeveral programmes, such as Oportunidades in Mexico, Bolsa Familia  in Brazil, and Red \\nde Protección Social  in Nicaragua include requirements for receipt of transfers specific to \\naddressing nutritional concerns. Conditions intended to improve nutritional outcomes may \\naddress behaviours through group nutrition education sessions and growth monitoring and \\npromotion, which also may be accompanied by more personalized counselling. Conditionalities \\naimed at improving micronutrient status may be employed in CCT programmes through provision \\nof essential micronutrients and food or supplements to supply both macro- and micronutrients, \\nthough the latter has been limited to Mexico’s Progresa (65). \\nConditionalities in programmes with nutrition objectives may be determined based on country \\ncontext and nutrition actions for which there is evidence of efficacy. CCTs that are intended \\nto improve nutritional outcomes should be “well coordinated with the existing priorities guiding \\na country’s nutrition policy” ( 65). General agreement exists as to which interventions are the \\nmost efficacious, therefore guiding conditional requirements in CCT programmes. The efficacy \\nof these ENAs are described in Part I of this document and include: exclusive breastfeeding \\nfor six months, appropriate complementary feeding, appropriate nutritional care of sick and \\nseverely malnourished children, adequate intake of vitamin A and iron for women and children \\nand adequate intake of iodine by all household members ( 65 from 66).'),\n",

CCTs offer greater flexibility for determination of household needs and decreased \\nlogistical costs relative to in-kind transfers. In comparison to unconditional transfer programmes \\nCCTs are promoted as a direct investment in human capital, as well as an incentive for households \\nto adopt behaviours that improve well-being, both offering long-term benefits ( 62). \\nVarious mechanisms by which CCT programmes work to improve maternal and child nutrition \\nhave been proposed:\\n■■ As women typically receive the cash transfer, programme beneficiaries may be empowered \\nto prioritize care for both themselves and their children during the CCT programme and even \\nafter it ends (65).\\n■■ An increase in household purchasing power for food and health services may result from \\nCCT programmes ( 65). Due to the multifactoral nature of undernutrition, complementary \\ninterventions need to be supplied and maintained in addition to income provision for real \\nimprovement (67). \\n■■ Direct provision of micronutrients and/or energy supplements may be provided to mothers \\nand children, though this practice has not been widespread in CCT programmes thus far (65).\\n■■ Conditionalities such as growth monitoring for children, antenatal care for mothers, and \\nparticipation in nutrition education sessions for both may improve maternal and child nutrition \\nby addressing behavioural determinants of undernutrition ( 65).\\nAn important consideration of the ability of CCTs to improve nutritional status involves determining \\nthe effects of providing both demand- and supply-side incentives. Transfers offered to families \\ncan increase demand for health and nutrition services by overcoming barriers to access such as \\ndirect costs, indirect costs (transport, food during hospitalization) and opportunity costs (loss of \\nincome due to health-seeking activities). CCTs aimed at increasing demand for preventive services \\nmay also have positive spillover effects, thus furthering long-term benefits for beneficiaries ( 62). \\nInadequate or poor quality supply of services limits the effectiveness of demand-side CCTs. \\nTherefore some programmes are implementing supply-side transfers in addition to those typically \\nprovided directly to beneficiaries. For example, the Programa de Asignación Familiar  (PRAF) \\nprovides health centres with approximately US$ 6000 annually for meeting quality improvement \\nand service standards at rural health posts, including nutrition training for mothers ( 68). \\n8.2 Coverage and resource intensities\\nIn CCT programmes providing both demand and supply-side incentives the effects on health and \\nnutritional outcomes of each as well as the combination should be distinguished. For example, an \\nevaluation of Honduras’s PRAF demonstrated that demand-side transfers resulted in the largest \\nppt increase in healthcare visits among children under three years of age, as well as attendance \\nat growth monitoring within the same age group as compared to controls. The combination of \\ndemand- and supply-side benefits increased utilization of both health visits and growth monitoring \\nto a lesser extent, but supply-side incentives alone failed to increase utilization of either. The \\ndemand- and supply-side benefits individually and in combination resulted in improvements in \\nantenatal care attendance (five or more sessions), although supply-side incentives resulted in the \\nlowest percentage point increase (65). This example may be flawed since health facilities received \\nslightly more than one half of their expected incentives, but it is reasonable to assume that supply-\\nside incentives may be beneficial only when demand-side transfers are offered concurrently. \\nCash transfer programmes vary in implementation stage as pilots, early or small-scale programmes \\nor national coverage (see Table II-5 and details in Annex 1). Among pilot and early or small-scale \\nprogrammes, mostly CTs in sub-Saharan Africa and CCTs in Latin America, coverage ranges \\nfrom approximately 4000 beneficiaries, as in Zambia’s Kalomo Pilot Social Cash Transfer Scheme \\n(69) to 165 000 beneficiaries in Nicaragua’s RPS ( 70). This coverage represents less than 1% \\nand 3% of the populations respectively. Large-scale CCT programmes, mostly in operation in'),\n",

About 15% and 25% of the \\npopulation (100% of the targeted poor) are covered with these programmes respectively.\\nEstimates of programme intensity are based on the amount of transfer provided to beneficiaries. \\nAmong CT programmes, transfers range from US$ 6/household per month in Mozambique’s \\nNational Institute of Social Action (INAS) Food Subsidy Programme (PSA) ( 71) to US$ 25/\\nhousehold per month in South Africa’s Child Support Grant (CSG) (72). Among CCT programmes, \\nthe lowest estimate of expenditure was US $4/household per month in Honduras’s PRAF, or less \\nthan 10% of average household consumption ( 73). In contrast, the highest expenditure was \\nUS$ 60/household per month in Brazil’s BF programme ( 65) or approximately 15% of average \\nhousehold consumption (73). It should be noted that among BF beneficiaries not all households \\nreceive this amount as transfers are dependent upon the level of poverty and number of children. \\n8.3 Effect on nutrition outcomes\\nEffectiveness of CCTs is estimated mostly from programmes in Latin America. It is based on data \\nfor various age groups of children and a variety of outcomes, thus making comparisons with large-\\nscale nutrition programmes themselves (as in this document) problematic. However, impacts on \\nchild growth, birth weight, as well as on food expenditure and consumption have been estimated \\n(see Annex 2, last column).\\nMexico’s Oportunidades has multiple evaluations reporting an approximate 1.0 cm increase in \\nheight among children ages 0–6 months and 12–36 months, all as compared to controls ( 62). \\nImprovement in HAZ scores as compared to controls of 0.13 (Brazil’s BF, children less than 7 \\nyears of age), 0.25 (South Africa’s CSG, children less than 36 months), 0.161 (Colombia’s FA, \\nchildren less than 24 months), and 0.17 (Nicaragua’s RPS, children less than 5 years) were \\nreported (62, 72).\\nIncrease in birth weight of 0.13 kg was reported among beneficiaries as compared to controls \\nin Mexico’s Oportunidades (74). Additionally, an increase of 0.58 kg in “newborn” weight was \\nreported for beneficiaries in Colombia’s FA, although this should be interpreted with caution since \\nthe programme was targeted to children rather than mothers. Although mixed results have been \\nfound, there is evidence that CCT programmes can have a positive impact on child nutritional \\nstatus. To date most CCT programmes designed to improve nutritional and health outcomes have \\ntargeted children rather than mothers, resulting in a lack of data available on changes in maternal \\nnutritional status (65).\\n8.4 Linkage to direct nutrition programmes\\nBoth types of cash transfer programmes offer a link to existing nutrition programmes within a \\ncountry. Furthermore, they may work to bolster both demand- and supply-side improvements in \\nnutrition services at the community level. When considering implementation of a cash transfer \\nprogramme designed to improve undernutrition, several rules for determining appropriateness \\nof using nutrition-related conditionalities have been proposed. An unconditional CT programme \\nshould be used when nutrition programmes of good quality are in place and utilized extensively. \\nIn contrast, a CCT programme is more useful when current nutrition programmes are not well-\\nutilized, but quality is good. CCTs in addition to supply-side incentives should be considered \\nwhen both quality and utilization of nutrition programmes is poor. Finally, when a country does not \\nhave an existing nutrition programme a CCT should be considered only when both services of \\nappropriate quality can be introduced and when beneficiaries are able to utilize the services (65). \\nA number of important factors are likely to affect the positive impact of CCTs on maternal and \\nchild nutrition outcomes. Programmes should focus on the window of opportunity for nutrition \\nimpact, pregnancy through two years of age, and therefore target beneficiaries in this range. \\nConditionalities should be specific to nutrition, based on best practices, including ENAs, for \\nwhich there is evidence of efficacy. Supply-side transfers should be provided when needed in \\norder to maintain quality and quantity of health and nutrition services, thus increasing the ability \\nof CCTs to improve the nutritional status of mothers and children.'),\n",

This led into the National Nutrition Program, 2004–\\n2007, whose intended coverage was 105/464 thanas. Both of these programmes were \\nsupported by the World Bank. Various issues inhibited activities, which appear to have been \\nabsorbed into the Health and Nutrition Population Sector Programme (HNPSP), 2007–2010 \\n(25% nutrition and food security; about $4300 million, 37% external funding).\\nHNPSP has no available evaluation data, and disbursement up to July 2010 was about \\n5%, so the progamme appears to have been slow in starting activities. Components are \\ndescribed in the project appraisal document. The World Bank implementation completion \\nreport (1) on National Nutrition Program was critical of the plan and the ineffective \\nimplementation. This followed considerable earlier debate on the effectiveness of the BINP, \\nand most of the available data on process and outcome stem from this earlier programme. It \\nis not clear whether support to community nutrition promoters continued under the HNPSP.\\nDuring BINP internal evaluations were commissioned ( 2), then challenged by Save the \\nChildren (3) based on a retrospective cross-sectional survey. White and Massett ( 4) \\nconcluded that the reduction in malnutrition (underweight or stunting) which could be \\nascribed to BINP activities was about 2 ppt (about 0.3 ppt/year). However, early data did \\nshow an initial substantial reduction in severe underweight, as in other projects, and about \\n20 g improvement in birth weight was attributed to BINP activities.\\nProgramme design was similar to that for TINP, involving growth monitoring, with \\nsupplementary feeding for children with growth faltering and nutrition counselling. Reasons \\nfor low effectiveness may include:\\n■■ targeting for supplementary feeding was fairly ineffective, and food was shared;\\n■■ community nutrition promoters were of low intensity (approximately 1:150 households) \\nand worked out of community nutrition centres rather than making home visits;\\n■■ while there was some effect on knowledge and to a lesser degree on practices, these \\ndid not translate into nutritional impact.\\nBINP itself was of low effectiveness and did not lead to a sustainable set of actions. In part \\nthis was due to the project design and inadequate intensity, and in part to complexities in \\nimplementation (institutional and otherwise). Under the HNPSP there appears to be less \\nemphasis on community-based actions and services.'),\n",

Nutrition Programme Case Studies\\nBrazil\\nThe Child Pastorate Programme was implemented in 1983 by the Catholic Church of Brazil. \\nIt remains in operation to the time of writing and is funded by multiple sources, including \\nthe MoH (80%), Electric Company, Ministry of Education, the GLOBO television network \\nand UNICEF. In 2001 Child Pastorate Programme coverage by area was about 63% \\n(5140/8159 parishes), providing services to 32 265 communities. Coverage by population \\nfor the same year was about 1.6 million children less than 6 years of age (9.8% of total \\npopulation for age group), in addition to more than 77 000 pregnant women. Resource \\nintensity for the Child Pastorate Programme is US$ 4/person per year and personnel \\nintensity is 1 community worker:37 children less than 6 years of age. Total funding for the \\nprogramme for 1999–2000 was US$ 6.9 million.\\nInternal evaluations were conducted from 1988–2001 with reported decreases in \\nmalnourished children (from 18% to 4%) and pregnant women (from 20% to 4%), as well \\nas low birth weight (from 14% to 6%). An increase in EBF during the first 4 months was also \\nreported (from 60% to 80%). External evaluation data are unavailable. \\nThe Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) was implemented in Brazil in 1997 \\nand by 2002 had begun in all states, within the context of the Family Health Programme, \\nwhich is supported by the World Bank and the MoH. Coverage reported for the Family \\nHealth Programme is variable since municipalities must apply to the federal government and \\nmake a financial contribution to join the programme. Teams are trained in both Family Health \\nProgramme and IMCI principles though IMCI training is lagging behind that of FHP. Intensity \\nof CHWs is reported as 1 per 100–200 families ( 5). The impact of IMCI on nutritional status \\nin Brazil has not been reported. \\nBolsa Alimentacão was a CCT programme from 2001–2003, when it merged with several \\nprogrammes to form the current Bolsa Familia Programme (BFP). Coverage of Bolsa \\nAlimentacão in 2003 was 1.5 million persons (about 1% of the population) supported by the \\nWorld Bank and managed by the MoH. Families with pregnant or lactating women and/or \\nchildren less than 7 years of age with a monthly per capita income below US$ 42 received \\nUS$ 7 per child monthly, for up to 3 children. Conditions for receipt of the transfer included \\nregular pre- and postnatal care, growth monitoring, immunization, and participation in \\nnutrition education seminars ( 6). \\nInitial evaluation data from Bolsa Alimentacão showed worsening height-for-age z-scores \\n(HAZ) and weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) for beneficiaries compared to non-beneficiaries, \\nthough results were not statistically significant ( 7). This result was despite a reported \\nincrease in food consumption, which may have been due to beneficiary mothers assuming \\nthey would be ineligible for benefits if children were healthy. \\nThe Bolsa Alimentacão programme was incorporated into the BFP in 2003. BFP coverage \\nin 2006 was 11.1  million families (46 million persons), approximately 100% of the poor \\nand 25% of the total Brazilian population. Public expenditure for the BFP in 2005 was US$ \\n3.2 billion, equivalent to 0.36% of GDP ( 6). World Bank support for the programme was \\nabout US$ 562 million from 2003–2009, or approximately US$ 93.7 million/year ( 8). The \\nentire BFP is overseen by the Ministry of Social Development, while the health component \\nis managed by the MoH. Monthly cash transfers range from US$ 7–US$ 45 per family \\ndepending upon eligibility as determined by monthly per capita income ceilings of US$ \\n57 (moderately poor) and US$ 29 (extremely poor). Targeting of pregnant and lactating \\nmothers and children less than 7 years of age and health conditions for receipt of the \\ntransfer remain as they did in Bolsa Alimentacão.'),\n",

Nutrition Programme Case Studies\\nColombia\\nHogares Comunitarios is a national community nursery programme that started in 1986 \\nand at the time of writing is still in operation. It is funded principally by the Colombian \\ngovernment but also to a very small part by the parents of the children who participate \\nthrough a monthly fee (US$ 4) used to provide a small salary to the community mother \\nwho runs the nursery. Funding for the programme is US$ 250 million annually. Children \\nsix years of age and younger in poor neighborhoods are targeted. In 2004, approximately \\n80 000 Hogares Comunitarios were in operation nationally, with an average of 12 children \\nattending each (maximum 15); about 1 million children 6 years of age and younger attend. \\nSupplementary feeding is a major programme component, as children are provided lunch \\nand two snacks daily in addition to a supplemental beverage; in total 70% of daily caloric \\nneeds are provided ( 9). \\nEvaluation data for Hogares Comunitarios reported an increase in HAZ in children 0–72 \\nmonths based on variables of programme attendance/participation (0.486), of number of \\nmonths in the programme (0.013), and of the exposure (number of months adjusted by age \\nof child) to Hogares Comunitarios (0.78). Changes in WAZ were not significant. \\nFamilias en Acción is a large-scale CCT programme that began in 2002 and remains \\nin operation at the time of writing. It is implemented by the Colombian government and \\nsupported by both the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank; total annual \\nfunding in 2004 was US$ 95 million. Coverage of Familias en Acción in 2005 was 66% \\nof municipalities (700/1060) and 5% of the population, roughly 400 000 households or \\n2.1 million persons (10). Children 7 years of age and younger in the lowest income category \\nare targeted for the programme, which includes roughly the poorest 20% of households \\n(11). The nutrition/health component transfer for Familias en Acción is US$ 17/month per \\nmother, independent of the number of children in the household, which is equivalent to \\napproximately 24% of total household expenditure ( 12). Conditions for receipt of the transfer \\ninclude regular health visits and growth monitoring. \\nEvaluation data of Familias en Acción has demonstrated an increase in HAZ score of 0.161 \\nin children less than 24 months of age; though this increase is not significant, it translates to \\na 6.9% decrease in the risk of being chronically undernourished ( 11). In addition, Familias \\nen Acción participants in urban areas experienced an increase in newborn weight of 57.8 \\ng. This finding should be interpreted with caution since the programme was targeted to \\nchildren, not mothers.'),\n",

Key nutrition activities of the NNP include:\\n1. Health Extension Programme (HEP)\\n2. Promotion of Essential Nutrition Actions\\n3. Community-based Nutrition (CBN)\\n4. Therapeutic Feeding Programme (TFP)\\n5. Enhanced Outreach Strategy (EOS)/ Extended Enhanced Outreach Strategy (EEOS) \\nand Targeted Supplementary Feeding (TSF).\\nThe HEP (2005–time of writing) is the core strategy for universal primary health service \\ncoverage. The programme, operating with multi-donor support, aims to improve family health \\nstatus through disease prevention and control at the community level. Under the HEP, \\nthe Government of Ethiopia aimed for a ratio of 1 health extension worker (HEW):2500 \\npersons and 1 health post:5000 persons. After year-long training, HEWs deliver preventive, \\npromotive and selected curative activities according to 16 modules. These incorporated \\nIMCI (from 2002) and Essential Nutrition Actions (from 2004). As of 2009, 83% of target \\nkebeles (sub-districts) had health post coverage, and 100% of the target HEWs (30 000) \\nhad been trained and deployed. However, resource intensity for the programme remains low: \\nGovernment of Ethiopia spending on health is only 7.5% of the total government budget, \\nand total per capita public health expenditure was US$ 3.00 in 2008, below the target \\nexpenditure of US$ 4.80 per capita estimated for full implementation of the HEP ( 13). \\nThe CBN (2008 –present) was launched in 2008 and will expand to cover 35% of \\nEthiopia’s total population (228 woredas1) by the first half of 2011. CBN is focused on \\nchildren under two and uses monthly growth monitoring and promotion to involve families \\nand community members in assessing health and nutrition-related problems, analysing \\ncauses of these problems, taking action and monitoring progress. Other important \\nprocesses in CBN include strengthened referral of severely underweight children to \\nTFPs and/or TSFs as required; control of micronutrient deficiencies through biannual \\nvitamin A supplementation and deworming; and quarterly screening for acute malnutrition \\nthrough Community Health Days. CBN activities are facilitated by HEWs and voluntary \\nCHWs (1:30–50 households). Per capita costs are not available. Initial analysis of routine \\nprogramme data from 1.5 million under-2 children weighed in 4 regions showed a decline in \\nunderweight from 30% in January 2009 to 20% in March 2010 (8 ppt/year). 2 \\nIn TFPs (2008–present), children with complicated SAM receive care through therapeutic \\nfeeding units, and children with uncomplicated SAM are managed in the community through \\nOutpatient Therapeutic Programmes (OTP) at decentralized sites. There are more than \\n5000 OTP sites across 200 woredas.\\n1 woreda: primary administrative unit (district) \\n2 Mason J and Hoblitt A, personal communication, 2010.'),\n",

Nutrition Programme Case Studies\\nEOS/TSF Programmes (2004–present) are jointly operated by the MoH with UNICEF \\nsupport and the Disaster Risk Management and Food Security Sector with World Food \\nProgramme support. The EOS targets children 6–59 months for vitamin A supplementation, \\nmeasles vaccination, insecticide-treated bednets in malarial areas, health messages and \\ndeworming. Children 6–59 months and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) are also \\nscreened using mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). Those identified as moderately \\nmalnourished are referred to TSF for 3-month supplementary food rations, where available \\n(14). The EOS/TSF programme began in 2004 as a pilot, and quickly scaled up to cover \\n6.8 million children in 365 drought-prone woredas. In 2005/6, the programme was \\nexpanded through the EEOS, which covers additional woredas with a reduced package \\nof only vitamin A supplementation and deworming. National coverage by EOS and EEOS \\nhas expanded to reach around 95% of children under 5, at an estimated cost of US$ 1.14 \\nper child.1 In 2008, the programme covered 163 food-insecure woredas (2.9 million \\nchildren 6–59 months and 600 000 PLW), provided targeted supplementary food to \\n720 000 children and 420 000 PLW, and cost about US$ 43 million. Under HEP, the EOS \\nprogramme is currently phasing out and being replaced by Community Health Days. These \\nevents will offer the same inputs as EOS but will move away from the regionally-supported \\nbiannual mobilizations and instead be carried out quarterly, supported by the district health \\nstructures and HEWs (15). \\nThe PSNP (2005–present) is a partnership between the GoE and a group of donors \\nproviding direct budgetary support through a multi-donor trust fund. Outside of South \\nAfrica, PSNP is the largest social protection programme in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2009, \\nPSNP reached nearly 10% of the country (7.6 million people), covering more than 40% \\nof the woredas. The annual budget is around US$ 360 million. Per capita, cash and food \\ntransfers totaled US$ 32.8 for male-headed households and US$ 37.1 for female-headed \\nhouseholds in 2007 (16). PSNP employs geographic, administrative and community-based \\ntargeting to identify chronically food-insecure populations. The objective of the programme \\nis to improve food security and prevent vulnerable households from having to sell assets \\n(nutrition is not explicitly addressed). Cash and/or in-kind support is provided to targeted \\nhouseholds in exchange for labour-intensive public works to build community assets. Labour-\\npoor households (i.e. female-headed households with young children, the elderly, PLWs) \\nreceive unconditional transfers. An impact evaluation in 2008 found no significant change in \\nanthropometric status of children in PSNP households compared to non-PSNP households. \\nHowever, participation had positive effects on use of education and health services and \\nhousehold food security, caloric acquisition, and asset protection ( 17). \\n1 UNICEF Ethiopia, personal communication, 2010.'),\n",

AIN-C is supported by the Honduran MoH, and received \\nmajor funding from United States Agency for International Development from 1998–2005 \\n(initial planning and support began in 1991). Coverage of the programme by area was 24 \\nof 42 health areas (>50%) in 2006 (18), and by population was 90% of children less than \\n24 months of age. Intensity as measured by CHNWs:children is 3:25, where CHNWs work \\npart-time for 3.5 hours weekly. Financial resource intensity is US$ 6.43/child per year ( 18). \\nThe programme is targeted at children less than 24 months of age and sick children 24–\\n60 months of age. Activities of the AIN-C are carried out at monthly growth monitoring and \\npromotion sessions at the community centre, although home visits are provided for children \\nwho do not attend. Components of the programme include nutrition counselling for EBF \\nless than 6 months of age, complementary feeding less than 24 months of age, and hygienic \\npractices; micronutrient distribution for children (iron and vitamin A); medication distribution \\nfor illness; antenatal care (newborn visits); and referral to the health facility as needed ( 19).\\nEvaluation of the AIN-C was planned as a pre- and post-intervention, project and control \\ncomparison study, but the design was altered due to extensive contamination of control \\ncommunities, non-equivalent groups, and reduced intensity of programme implementation \\ndue to changes in funding. A cross-sectional study using baseline data compared AIN-C \\nparticipants to non-participants. Improved caring practices were reported among AIN-C \\nmothers. A 15.8 ppt difference in EBF at 6 months was found (55.8% AIN-C, 40% non-\\nAIN-C). With regard to receiving iron and vitamin A supplementation, differences of 36.1 \\nppt (65.6% AIN-C, 29.5% non-AIN-C) and 6.8 ppt (94.3% AIN-C, 87.5% non-AIN-C) \\nrespectively, were reported for children. Mean height-for-age was lower in the AIN-C \\ngroup as compared to non-participants at less than six months of age. At 6–11 months \\nand 12–23 months of age, there was no difference between AIN-C children and non-\\nparticipants, suggesting a protective effect of AIN-C against growth faltering. Since a pre-/\\npost- comparison was not possible, this conclusion cannot be certain ( 20). Intensity of \\nparticipation in the programme was based on percentage of possible weighings attended \\nby the child; after controlling for household assets and age of child, for every 1% increase in \\nparticipation intensity, weight-for-age increased 0.005 z-score ( 20).'),\n",

Nutrition Programme Case Studies\\nIndia\\nTwo major health and nutrition programmes were evaluated: Integrated Child Development \\nScheme (ICDS) and Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Programme (TINP). TINP 1, funded \\nby the World Bank, operated from 1980 to 1989 and TINP II operated from 1990 to 1997. \\nICDS was initiated by the Government of India (GoI) in 1975 and continues today. From \\n1990 to 1997, the World Bank supported ICDS I in Orissa and Andhra Pradesh, and from \\n1993 to 2001, supported ICDS II in Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.\\nAn important conclusion to draw from this analysis of large-scale nutrition programmes in \\nIndia is that a lack of proper evaluation is a major constraint to the development of evidence-\\nbased nutrition policies. \\nTINP I (1980–1989)\\nAmong TINP participants, there was an approximate 1.25 to 2.40 ppt/ year decline in \\nunderweight prevalence. In TINP areas, there was an approximate 0.83 to 1.12 ppt/year \\ndecline in underweight prevalence as compared with non-TINP areas where an approximate \\n0.26 to 1.12 ppt/year decrease in underweight prevalence was observed. The estimated \\nunderlying trend for the whole of India during this time was a 0.7 ppt/year decrease in \\nunderweight prevalence. Thus an estimated one quarter to one half of the decrease in \\nunderweight prevalence is attributable to the project.\\nThere are important issues related to data sources. Data on residents in TINP and non-\\nTINP areas (rather than on TINP participants) come from the National Nutrition Monitoring \\nBureau (NNMB) while data on TINP participants comes from programme monitoring \\nrecords. NNMB estimates are from an 11-year period (1979–1990) while TINP estimates \\nare from an 8-year period (1982–1990). Furthermore, NNMB surveys consistently produce \\nhigher estimated underweight prevalence than TINP surveys because NNMB surveys cover \\nentire areas rather than only programme participants. This may reveal differences between \\nparticipants and non-participants.\\nTINP II (1990–1997)\\nTINP II built off the lessons learned during TINP I. The components of TINP II remained the \\nsame as those in TINP II, although additional components were added.\\nAmong TINP II participants, there was an approximate 6.0 ppt/year decrease in underweight \\nprevalence. In TINP areas, there was an average 1.1 ppt/year decline in underweight \\nprevalence. The underlying trend in Tamil Nadu at that time was estimated by the \\nWorld Bank to be 5.0–7.0 ppt/year, which is most certainly an overestimate. In its 1998 \\nImplementation Completion Report for TNIP I, the World Bank suggests 2.0 ppt/year as a \\nmore realistic estimate of the underlying nutritional trend in Tamil Nadu. \\nOverall, TINP II was found to be successful in achieving its objective to decrease severe \\nmalnutrition but not successful in achieving its objective for moderate malnutrition. The latter \\nobjective may have been too ambitious, and underlying trends may have been overestimated.\\nICDS (1975–present)\\nIn 1998, ICDS was implemented in approximately 45% of the poorest villages and 60% of \\nthe richest villages in India. Universal coverage is a major goal of the programme, although \\nit has proven difficult to reach certain remote areas and vulnerable groups. A major issue \\nrelated to the effectiveness of the programme is the fact that coverage is much higher in'),\n",

The intensity also tends to be significantly higher \\nin areas that are wealthier. \\nAn evaluation by Lokshin and colleagues ( 21) found no statistically significant differences \\nbetween the “treatment” group (children living in areas with ICDS) and the “control” group \\n(children living in areas without ICDS). Using propensity score matching, the difference \\nbetween HAZ scores among “cases” and “controls” was found to be only 0.056 in 1992 \\nand 0.024 in 1998. Similarly, the difference between WAZ scores among “cases” and \\n“controls” was found to be -0.044 (in the opposite direction expected) in 1992 and 0.001 \\nin 1998. None of the differences was statistically significant. These figures (derived from \\nNational Family Health Surveys) can be used only to investigate differences at one point in \\ntime, rather than to examine trends year to year, and thus provide for only weak attribution of \\nchanges to programme activities.\\nICDS I (1990–1997) \\nBetween 1990 and 1997, the World Bank supported ICDS activities in Andhra Pradesh and \\nOrissa. \\nAccording to programme monitoring data, the decrease in underweight prevalence was \\nfound to be approximately 3.2 ppt/year in Andhra Pradesh and 0.05 ppt/year in Orissa. This \\ndata represents changes among programme participants rather than among community \\nmembers as a whole. The underlying trend in underweight prevalence was estimated to be \\n2.8 ppt/year in Orissa and 4.2 ppt/year in Andhra Pradesh. Overestimation of the underlying \\ntrend may have caused an underestimation of the effectiveness of ICDS I in Andhra Pradesh.\\nAccording to the World Bank, definitive judgments on the effectiveness of ICDS I \\ncannot be made due to a lack of high-quality data.

Nutrition Programme Case Studies\\nIndonesia\\nThe Family Nutrition Improvement Programme (UPGK) ran from 1975 to 1990, followed by \\nthe Third Community Health and Nutrition Project (CHN3) from 1993 to 2000. They were \\nsupported by the World Bank and combined participation and inputs from the MoH as well \\nas from the community.\\nThe UPGK (centred on Posyandus) projects were based on the strategy of consistent \\nmonthly weight gain in healthy children targeting children under five and their mothers. The \\nactivities included weighing, education, micronutrient supplementation and supplementary \\nfeeding in combination with other health interventions through weighing posts managed by \\ncommunity leaders and volunteers ( 25). The cost per beneficiary was US$ 2 for weighing-\\nscreening and US$ 11 per beneficiary for weighing-feeding. In all regions, 58 355 villages \\nreceived access to weighing posts, and coverage reached 17 million children or 80% of \\nthe under-5 population. Of those 80%, 77% received services and 47% were weighed \\nmonthly. Of those weighed monthly, 54% showed consistent weight gain, but active long-\\nterm participation ranged from only 34%–69% ( 26). The level of severe protein-energy \\nmalnutrition declined from 3%–5% to 1%. \\nBoth process and impact evaluations were performed on UPGK. A longitudinal study \\nshowed positive changes in health practices. However the degree to which these changes, \\nor any change in nutritional status of the programme target population, can be attributed \\nto the programme cannot be defined. Inclusion of too many other health issues may have \\ndiluted the nutrition interventions ( 27). Other evaluation results indicate high programme \\naccess and initial coverage above 80% but reduced active participation over time. A lack of \\nbaseline data makes impact difficult to assess. \\nCHN3 picked up where UPGK left off, running from 1993 to 2001 with a US$ 3.6 million \\ninvestment in improving nutritional status by the World Bank and US$ 0.6 million by the \\nGovernment of Indonesia. This project focused on capacity building, health information \\nsystems, education and service delivery in a province-based model in five provinces. From \\n1989 to 2003 underweight (<-2 SD WAZ) decreased from 37.5% to 27.5% (0.71 ppt/year) \\ndespite the financial crisis of the early 1990s. This decrease may be partially attributed to a \\nreduction in birthrate in the lowest quintile of the population ( 28). A World Bank evaluation \\nof the project determined that design made the project difficult to supervise and that poor \\nmonitoring and evaluation of performance made assessment of project effectiveness difficult \\nto determine (29). \\nImprovements in childhood malnutrition have been seen from the early 1980s. National level \\nprogrammes such as UPGK achieved strong access and initial coverage but met significant \\nproblems of sustained results, in part due to dilution of focus. Attempts to decentralize \\nhealth interventions to the provincial level with CHN3 faced challenges of implementation \\nand monitoring. Lack of baseline and surveillance data made effectiveness of these projects \\ndifficult to define.'),\n",

Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) were contracted to provide \\nservices to beneficiaries and supervision for community nutrition workers (CNWs) in target \\nareas. CNWs provided services at community nutrition centers and were paid in rice by \\nSECALINE for working on the project five days each week. The ratio of beneficiaries to \\nnutrition workers was approximately 400 to 1200 children and 200 women for each worker. \\nThe cost per child beneficiary was approximately US$ 7.31 per year. The programme \\nobjective was to reduce food insecurity and malnutrition in Madagascar’s two most food-\\ninsecure provinces through income generating projects and targeted nutrition programmes.\\nAccording to interim findings by the World Bank ( 30), there was a 14 ppt decrease in \\nunderweight prevalence among child participants in Antananarivo and a 10 ppt decrease in \\nunderweight prevalence among child participants in Toliary between January 1994 and June \\n1996. This amounted to a 5.6 ppt/year decrease in malnutrition in Antananarivo and a 4 ppt/ \\nyear decrease in malnutrition in Toliary. The programme was deemed successful and was \\nsubsequently scaled up to cover all regions in the country through SEECALINE (see below).\\nSEECALINE (1999–2003) \\nThe SEECALINE (Second Surveillance and Education for Schools and Communities on \\nFood and General Nutrition) programme began in 1999 and was gradually scaled-up until \\n2002. Upon completion of scale-up activities, there were 3600 project sites in half the \\ndistricts in Madagascar. SEECALINE targeted communities with poorer nutritional status \\nas sites for implementation. Thus, communities with the programme had higher baseline \\nlevels of malnutrition than communities that did not have the programme. A key feature is that \\nservices are contracted out and provided by local NGOs in the target area. Activities were \\ncoordinated by a paid CNW in each programme site. Each site (and each CNW) serves \\nbetween 200 and 500 women and children. There is a coverage rate of approximately 50% \\nof children under the age of 3 years in each target area. The programme objective was to \\nimprove the nutritional status of children under three, PLW, and school-aged children\\nSEECALINE was evaluated by the World Bank in two different ways:\\nFirst, Galasso and Yau (31) utilized monitoring data to estimate improvements in the \\nnutritional status of child participants. Over the course of 3 years, there was approximately \\na 7–9 ppt decrease in underweight prevalence among programme participants (2.33–\\n3.0 ppt/year). Galasso and Yau ( 31) found that “the returns are decreasing as time and \\nduration increase, though they do not dissipate to zero.” Results also showed higher \\ndifferential returns in poorer areas and areas more vulnerable to disease.\\nSecond, Galasso and Umapathi ( 32) utilized two nationally representative surveys to \\ncalculate the improvements in child nutritional status in programme areas rather than among \\nprogramme participants. Between the 1997/98 and 2004 surveys, they found a 5.2–7.5 ppt \\ndecrease in underweight prevalence in programme areas (0.86–1.25 ppt/year).'),\n",

Nutrition Programme Case Studies\\nMexico\\nOportunidades (known as Progresa from 1997–2002) is a CCT programme in operation \\nat the time of writing. The programme is funded by the government of Mexico with support \\nfrom the World Bank (US$ 1.5 billion in 2009). It was initiated in rural areas and expanded \\nto include urban areas beginning in 2002, although approximately 70% of programme \\nparticipants reside in rural areas. Total coverage in 2007 was 5 million families, or 20% \\nof the population. Targeting for Oportunidades is based on both geography, through \\nidentification of localities with high marginality indices, and socioeconomic status, through \\nproxy means testing. Approximately 60% of households in the bottom decile of per capita \\nexpenditures are participants, suggesting effective targeting of the poorest ( 33). \\nThe health and nutrition transfer component of Oportunidades is US$ 15/household per \\nmonth, about 20% of average monthly household expenditures ( 7), and is intended for \\nPLW, all children less than 2 years of age, and children less than 5 years of age with low \\nWAZ scores. Receipt of transfer is conditional upon regular health visits for all children \\nin which growth monitoring is included, pre- and postnatal care for women, and adult \\n(greater than 15  years of age) participation in health and nutrition education sessions. Iron \\nsupplementation and nutrition supplements are provided as well. The nutrition supplement is \\nintended to provide 20% of daily caloric and 100% of daily micronutrient requirements. \\nMultiple evaluations of Oportunidades have been conducted with data demonstrating \\nsignificant improvements in nutritional outcomes. In 2004, Rivera and colleagues ( 34) \\nreported an increase in height in children 0–6 months of 1.1 cm (26.4 cm versus 25.3 cm) \\nin programme beneficiaries compared to a control group ( 35). In rural children ages 12–24 \\nmonths, a significant increase in mean hemoglobin of 0.37 g/dl was found after 12 months \\nin the programme; 11.12 g/dl in the treatment group compared to 10.75 g/dl in the controls. \\nCorresponding anaemia prevalence among beneficiary children was 44.3% compared to \\n54.9% among control children, a significant 10.6 ppt decrease. Even with improvement, \\nnearly half of beneficiary children were still anaemic ( 34).\\nGertler (36) reported a significant increase in height of 0.96 cm in children 12–36 months in \\nthe treatment as compared to the control group, though there was no significant impact on \\nthe odds of being stunted. Treatment was defined as living in a locality covered by Progresa, \\ntherefore including children in households that were not receiving Progresa benefits. \\nThus, the estimates obtained from the study may be conservative ( 7). Anaemia prevalence \\nwas evaluated in rural children aged 12–48 months after 12 months in the programme; a \\nsignificant difference of 48.3% in beneficiary children compared to 41.1% in comparison \\nchildren was found (36). \\nA 2005 evaluation by Behrman and Hoddinott, as reviewed by Lagarde and colleagues ( 37), \\nfound a significant increase in height of 1.016 cm in children 12–36 months, although this \\noccurred in children whose mothers had greater than 5 years of schooling. \\nLeroy and colleagues (12) found a significant impact on height in children 0–6 months; an \\nincrease of 1.53 cm was seen in treatment children compared to control children. The mean \\nHAZ gain of 0.41 cm in this age group was also significant. When income/poverty tertiles \\nwere considered, a significant increase in height of 0.27 cm in the poorest tertile was found \\n(35). \\nBarber and Gertler ( 38) also reported positive impact of Oportunidades on nutritional \\noutcomes in 2008. They found a significantly higher birthweight of 127.3 g in programme \\nbeneficiaries and a 4.6 ppt reduction in LBW. When evaluated based on average beneficiary \\ntime, programme impact was 68.3 g, which was significant. Programme impact from cash \\nreceived was not significant at 78.2 g ( 35).'),\n",

It was a small-scale \\nCCT programme funded mainly by the Inter-American Development Bank, with contributions \\nfrom the Government of Nicaragua and the World Bank. Total funding was US$ 38 million. \\nThe RPS provided transfers for both nutrition/health and education upon meeting of certain \\nconditions by programme beneficiaries, although the education component will not be \\ndiscussed here. Coverage of the RPS in 2005 was about 165 000 persons, or 3% of the \\npopulation. Both geographical and household targeting was used for implementation in \\ndepartments and municipalities with high rates of extreme poverty. Intended beneficiaries \\nwere children 5 years of age and younger ( 7). \\nRPS participants received a nutrition/food security transfer equivalent to US$ 18/month \\nupon confirmation that conditions were met, although it has been reported that this was \\nnot strictly monitored. The transfer was equivalent to approximately 18% average monthly \\nhousehold expenditure. Conditions for receipt of the transfer included: monthly growth \\nmonitoring for children less than 24 months (every other month for children ages 2–5 years), \\nparticipation in nutrition and health education sessions on topics such as breastfeeding, \\nhygiene and feeding practices, regular vaccinations for children, and routine care for \\npregnant women. Antiparastic medications and iron supplements were also provided, \\nthough problems with delivery and noncompliance for iron have been reported ( 7). Supply-\\nside enhancements to ensure access to health care and ability to meet conditions were \\nimplemented as well by providing funding to private providers (mostly NGOs).\\nAvailable evaluation data from the RPS report a 19% improvement in per capita \\nconsumption in beneficiary households versus control households. Beneficiary household \\nconsumption was unchanged despite an economic crisis and drought while control \\nhousehold consumption decreased; the cash transfer may be beneficial in protecting \\nnutritional intake during times of crisis. An increase in HAZ of 0.17 was reported for \\nbeneficiary children and stunting decreased in RPS versus control groups by 5.5 ppt ( 39). A \\nsignificant change in underweight was also reported; it decreased in RPS areas (13.7% to \\n9.8%) while it increased in control areas (14.3% to 16.6%). Compared to national averages \\nfor this time period, the prevalence of underweight was much higher in both RPS and \\ncontrol areas. The cash transfer may have a greater impact in these rural, poor areas in times \\nof economic and environmental hardship. \\nAtención a Crisis ran from 2005–2006 as a pilot/experimental CCT programme designed \\nto help poor households in drought-affected regions of Nicaragua. Total funding was US$ \\n1.8 million, provided by the Ministry of Family. About 3000 households (approximately 16 \\n500 persons) in 6 municipalities that were affected by drought during the previous year were \\ntargeted by the programme. The food transfer amount was US$ 145/household per year \\n(US$ 24/every 2 months). Conditions for receipt of transfer included growth monitoring, \\nnutrition education and pre- and postnatal care for women. Supply-side benefits were \\nplanned for the programme but not implemented. \\nEvaluation data for Atención a Crisis show no impact on HAZ, WAZ or LBW. Due to the \\nshort duration of the programme and evaluation just after its completion, the lack of results is \\nunderstandable.'),\n",

The JNSP operated in 6/7 districts covering about \\n250 000 persons, 46 000 of whom were children (73% participation). Children less than \\n5 years of age and women were targeted, and selection was not based on socioeconomic \\nstatus. Resource intensity of the JNSP ranged from US$ 8–US$ 17/child per year \\n(US$ 30/child per year total cost, equivalent to US$ 6 million). Intensity as measured by \\npersonnel was 2 village health workers/village (1220 total) or 1:40 children. \\nJNSP evaluation data demonstrated a decrease in underweight from 50% to 35% (1984–\\n1988), or 4.5 ppt/year for the first 4 years of the programme. The decrease occurring in \\nthe first 2 years of the programme was even greater at 8 ppt/year, although the sustained \\ndecline in underweight in the population was 0.8 ppt/year (for years 2–7). The JNSP had \\ncomponents such as systems development and support, health services and water facilities, \\nbut these were not in place when the initial improvements in nutritional outcomes were seen. \\nThe reduction in malnutrition was attributed to increased feeding frequency, especially of \\nseverely underweight children at established child feeding posts, improved health care in \\nfamilies and communities and provision of information. \\nFollowing the success of the JNSP, the Child Survival and Development (CSD) Programme \\nwas initiated in 1985 and ran until 1995 with support from the World Bank. The programme \\naimed for complete coverage, although ultimately it was about 45% (9/20 regions), with \\napproximately 12 million beneficiaries, 2 million of whom were children. Resource intensity of \\nthe CSD programme was US$ 2–US$ 3/child per year ( 46).\\nAlthough coverage of the CSD programme was much greater than the JNSP and resource \\nintensity was less, evaluation demonstrates comparable results to those of the JNSP; an \\ninitial reduction in malnutrition of about 8 ppt/year for 1–2 years, then a continued decrease \\nof 1–2 ppt/year following the initial rapid decline. The difference in resource intensity may be \\ndue to the fact that supplementary feeding was not a component of the CSD programme. \\nIMCI was initiated in 1995 and is presently in operation with a goal of national coverage. It \\nis both facility- and community-based and supported by WHO and UNICEF. Coverage at \\nthe time of writing is varied. All 114 districts have received orientation and the majority (83% \\nin 2005) had carried out at least initial training. Resource intensity of IMCI is approximately \\nUS$ 11/child/year (US$ 1.70/child per year for routine care). IMCI has various components \\n(47). \\nEvaluation data from IMCI show a decrease in stunting, as measured by improvement in \\nconcentration indices in children aged 24–59 months in IMCI districts (-0.102 to -0.032) \\nin relation to comparison districts (-0.122 to -0.133) from 1999–2002 (48).

Intensity and impact \\nevaluation data are not available for CHDs; however, based on coverage and known efficacy \\nof these interventions, positive effects are plausible ( 50). \\nFrom 1999 to 2004/05, during operation of both IMCI and CHDs, overall stunting in \\nTanzania decreased from 48.3% to 44.4%, which is equivalent to approximately 0.7 ppt/\\nyear. Underweight in this time period decreased from 25.3% to 16.7%, which corresponds \\nto approximately 1.6 ppt/year. \\nThe Health Sector Development Project II (HSDP II) was launched in 2003 with support \\nfrom the World Bank and pooled funds from development partners. Total project funding \\nwas US$ 1.83 billion, 14% of which was designated for nutrition and food security \\n(US$ 256 million). The project was extended through 2009 to support completion of the \\nSecond Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP II), which was also launched in 2003 with the \\nsame scope as HSDP II. As reported in a World Bank project paper, funding for the original \\nproject has been expanded for 2009–2011 under the Third Health Sector Strategic Plan \\n(HSSP III), with the same scope and planned activities as the original project. Additional \\nfunding disbursed was US$ 30.9 million in pooled funds and US$ 9.1 million in non-pooled \\nWorld Bank funds. Proposed use for the additional non-pooled funds is implementation of \\na comprehensive food fortification programme to decrease micronutrient deficiencies in \\nTanzania.\\nIn the past, programmes in Tanzania that were multi-component, community-based, and \\nadequate in intensity resulted in reductions in malnutrition among children less than 5 years \\nof age. Improvements in both stunting and underweight have been seen during more recent \\nyears of implementation of both IMCI and CHDs, though effectiveness studies for CHDs \\nare unavailable. Evaluation of effectiveness of IMCI may be limited by a continued focus \\non training of facility-based health care workers, rather than implementation of community-\\nbased practices.'),\n",

In fact the rates from 1982 – \\nthe first growth monitoring data – and the recent national survey (2005/06) are somewhat \\nvague, but the overall major improvement is clear. \\nThe attribution of improved child nutrition to programme activities has not been made \\nthrough formal evaluations. Nutrition improvement started (1982–85) before rapid economic \\ngrowth (51, 52), and while no-one doubts the success and contribution of the Thai nutrition \\nprogramme (e.g. 53, 54) no attempt can be found in the literature to actually ascribe the \\nimprovement to the programme.\\nThe programme gave high priority to training village health volunteers and village health \\ncommunicators, at ratios of 1:100 and 1:10–20 to households (54). Coverage was reported \\nto reach nearly 100% of villages and 90% of children by 1990 ( 51). Cost estimates of \\naround US$ 10/household per year come from average budget figures. The components \\nwere seen as a menu from which villages could select priorities. These included antenatal \\ncare, breastfeeding support, growth monitoring and counselling, micronutrient provision, \\nlimited supplementary foods (including use of vouchers) plus group feeding, hygiene, basic \\nhealth services and others. Social mobilization, awareness and community participation \\nwere the key features, linked to evolving primary health care, while lessening reliance on \\ndirect top-down service delivery. A set of Basic Minimum Needs indicators, self-assessed \\nby communities, helped prioritize and monitor activities through a structure of facilitators \\n(local officers in health or other sectors), community leaders, and ‘mobilizers’ (village health \\ncommunicators and village health volunteers).'),\n",

Nutrition Programme Case Studies\\nVietnam\\nChild underweight improved at 1.5 to 2 ppt/year from around 1994 to 2008 according to \\nrepeated surveys and from the weighing programme (1999–2005 data). The Protein-Energy \\nMalnutrition (PEM) Control Programme operated in all 64 provinces of the country, covering \\n100% of communes with more than 10 000 health stations. About 100 000 nutritional \\ncollaborators were in place by 2005, a ratio of about 1:70 children at a cost of about \\nUS$ 0.70/child per year.\\nThe components were counselling for breastfeeding and complementary feeding; vitamin \\nA campaigns; iron in pregnancy; hygiene, sanitation and deworming for kindergartens; \\ngrowth monitoring; and nutrition products for malnourished children. During this period \\nthere were also rapid economic growth and poverty alleviation programmes, and iodized salt \\nwas adopted. Stunting reduction began at least by 1985. The portion of the recent nutrition \\nimprovement that can be ascribed to the PEM Control Programme has not been evaluated. \\nA small-scale trial ( 55) indicated minor effects on child anthropometry.\\nOverall, this is an example of a widely-implemented community-based programme, with \\nprobable impact that has not been evaluated. An estimate of 1.5 ppt/year improvement from \\nthe programme seems reasonable from the data published by year and province by the \\nMoH-National Institute of Nutrition ( 56).'),\n",

The causes of malnutrition are \\ndirectly related to inadequate dietary    intake as well \\nas disease, but indirectly to many factors, among \\nothers household food security, maternal and child \\ncare, health services and the environment. While \\nmost nutrition interventions   are delivered through \\nthe health sector, non-health interventions can also \\nbe critical. Actions should target the diﬀerent causes \\nto reach sustainable change, which requires a \\nmultisectoral  approach.\\nThis document includes WHO guidance on nutrition \\ninterventions targeting the /f_irst 1000 days of life. \\nFocusing on this package of essential nutrition \\nactions, policy-makers could reduce infant and    \\nchild mortality, improve physical and mental growth \\nand development, and improve productivity. Part I \\npresents the interventions currently recommended \\nby WHO, summarizes the rationale  and the \\nevidence, and describes the actions required to \\nimplement them. The document uses a life-course \\napproach, from pre-conception throughout the /f_irst \\ntwo years of life. Part II provides an analysis of \\ncommunity-based interventions aimed at improving \\nnutrition and indicates how eﬀective interventions \\ncan be delivered in an integrated fashion.\\nISBN 978 92 4 150555 0\\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT:\\nDepartment of Nutrition for Health and Development - World Health Organization\\n20, Avenue Appia  -  1211 Geneva 27  -  Switzerland - Fax: +41 22 791 4156 - Email: nutrition@who.int\\nwww.who.int/nutrition'),\n",

Deficiency in iron, a mineral necessary \\nto carry oxygen in haemoglobin, is thought to be the most common cause of anaemia. Iron deficiency can \\nresult from inadequate intake or absorption of dietary iron, increased need in periods of growth, increased \\nlosses from menstruation in adolescent girls, or infection by intestinal helminths, such as schistosomiasis or \\nhookworm infestation, in areas endemic to these parasites. \\nIron is an essential nutrient for development and cell growth in the immune and neural systems, as well \\nas in regulation of energy metabolism and exercise. The economic costs of iron deficiency anaemia from \\nannual physical productivity losses have been calculated to be around US$ 2.32 per capita, or 0.57% of gross \\ndomestic product in low- and middle-income countries. The WHO has consistently recommended oral iron \\nsupplementation as one of the interventions that can reduce the prevalence of anaemia.\\nIron is required for the survival and virulence of many pathogens. Concerns have been expressed on a possible \\nincreased risk of malaria with iron interventions in malaria-endemic areas, particularly among iron-replete \\nchildren. On the other hand, screening to identify iron deficiency in children prior to iron supplementation \\nis not feasible in many malaria-endemic settings. Given the importance and magnitude of anaemia globally, \\nparticularly in areas where malaria transmission is intense, an assessment of all available evidence has been \\ncarried out, to examine the safety and effectiveness of iron supplementation in children, including in malaria-\\nendemic areas.\\nPurpose of the guideline\\nThis guideline aims to help Member States and their partners in their efforts to make informed decisions on \\nthe appropriate nutrition actions to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (1), the global targets \\nset in the Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant and young child nutrition  (2) and the \\nGlobal strategy for women’s, children’s, and adolescents’ health (2016–2030)  (3). The recommendations in \\nthis guideline are intended for a wide audience, including policy-makers, their expert advisers, and technical \\nand programme staff at organizations involved in the design, implementation and scaling-up of programmes \\nfor anaemia prevention and control, and in nutrition actions for public health.\\nThe recommendations supersede those of previous WHO guidelines on iron supplementation in children \\nwhere they pertain specifically to daily oral iron supplementation among infants and children.\\nGuideline development methodology\\nWHO developed the present evidence-informed recommendations using the procedures outlined in the WHO \\nhandbook for guideline development (4). The steps in this process included: (i) identification of priority questions \\nand outcomes; (ii) retrieval of the evidence; (iii) assessment and synthesis of the evidence; (iv) formulation \\nof recommendations, including research priorities; and planning for (v) dissemination; (vi) implementation, \\nequity and ethical considerations; and (vii) impact evaluation and updating of the guideline. The Grading \\nof Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was followed (5), to \\nprepare evidence profiles related to preselected topics, based on up-to-date systematic reviews.\\n1 This publication is a World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. A WHO guideline is any document, whatever its title, containing WHO \\nrecommendations about health interventions, whether they be clinical, public health or policy interventions. A standard guideline is \\nproduced in response to a request for guidance in relation to a change in practice, or controversy in a single clinical or policy area, and \\nis not expected to cover the full scope of the condition or public health problem. A recommendation provides information about what \\npolicy-makers, health-care providers or patients should do. It implies a choice between different interventions that have an impact on \\nhealth and that have ramifications for the use of resources. All publications containing WHO recommendations are approved by the \\nWHO Guidelines Review Committee.'),\n",

One guideline group participated in a meeting concerning this \\nguideline, held in Geneva, Switzerland, on 20–25 February 2010, where the guideline was scoped. A second \\nguideline group participated in a meeting held in Geneva, Switzerland, on 14–18 March 2011, to discuss the \\nsafety of iron supplementation in children living in areas of high malaria transmission, and a third meeting was \\nconvened in Geneva, Switzerland, on 23–26 June 2014, where the guideline was finalized.

It will also \\nsupport Member States in their efforts to achieve the global targets set in the Comprehensive implementation \\nplan on maternal, infant and young child nutrition , as endorsed by the Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly in \\n2012, in resolution WHA65.6 (2), and the Global strategy for women’s, children’s, and adolescents’ health \\n(2016–2030) (3).\\nThe recommendations in this guideline are intended for a wide audience, including policy-makers, their \\nexpert advisers, and technical and programme staff at organizations involved in the design, implementation \\nand scaling-up of programmes for anaemia prevention and control, and in nutrition actions for public health. \\nThis document presents the key recommendations and a summary of the supporting evidence. \\nBACKGROUND\\nApproximately 300 million children globally had anaemia in 2011 (8, 9). The highest prevalence of anaemia is \\namong children aged under 5 years and women (10, 11). South Asia and central and west Africa continue to \\nhave the highest burden of anaemia (9–11).\\nAnaemia is characterized by a decrease in the number of red blood cells, sometimes with changed size or \\nshape of the red blood cells, to a level that impairs the normal physiological capacity of the blood to transport \\noxygen to cells around the body. Anaemia is measured most reliably by a fall in haemoglobin concentration \\nand can indicate poor nutrition and health (12, 13). Anaemia has been estimated to cause 68.4 million years \\nlost to disability in 2010, or 8.8% of disability from all conditions that year (11).\\nDeficiency in iron, a mineral necessary to carry oxygen in haemoglobin, is thought to be the most common \\ncause of anaemia (10–14). Iron deficiency can result from inadequate intake or absorption of dietary iron, \\nincreased need for iron in periods of growth or pregnancy, increased losses from menstruation, or infection \\nwith intestinal helminths such as schistosomiasis or hookworm infection, in areas where these infestations \\nare endemic (12–16). Other important causes of anaemia include infections such as malaria, tuberculosis \\nand HIV; other nutritional deficiencies such as of folate and vitamins B\\n12, A and C; genetic conditions and \\nhaemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and thalassaemia; and chronic kidney disease (9–11). Iron \\nis an essential nutrient in development and cell growth in the immune and neural systems, as well as in \\nregulation of energy metabolism and exercise (17,18) . Approximately 38–62% of anaemia is responsive \\nto iron supplementation. In malaria-hyperendemic settings, only 6–32% of anaemia is responsive to iron \\nsupplementation (19).\\nIron deficiency affects approximately two billion people worldwide; of these, about 500 million have anaemia \\n(20). The economic costs of iron deficiency anaemia from annual physical productivity losses have been \\ncalculated to be around US$ 2.32 per capita, or 0.57% of gross domestic product in low- and middle-income \\ncountries (21). WHO has consistently recommended iron supplementation as one of the interventions that \\ncan decrease rates of anaemia (22, 23).'),\n",

Iron \\nsupplementation has been shown to improve some of the mental or motor outcomes (18, 36–40), but the \\neffects of supplementation have been inconsistent (41–47) and some impairment may be irreversible  (29). \\nConversely, there are concerns that iron may produce adverse effects, including increased susceptibility to \\ninfections such as malaria (48–50) and impaired physical growth (51, 52).\\nAnaemia in infants and children\\nThe risks for anaemia in children start during gestation. Anaemia in the child’s mother during pregnancy is \\nassociated with increased risk of low birth weight and maternal and child mortality (53). Children born to \\nmothers with anaemia may be more likely to be iron deficient and anaemic early in life. This may irreversibly \\naffect the cognitive development and physical growth of infants (17, 23, 54, 55).\\nIron is required by infants to produce red blood cells in the first months after birth. Infants commonly use \\niron stored during the last months of gestation. When the infant is 4–6 months of age, the stores can become \\nlow or depleted. This is exacerbated when there are inadequate iron stores due to low birth weight and \\nprematurity (56); increased requirements from rapid growth and erythropoiesis; inadequate iron from the \\ndiet, such as in cases of early introduction of cereal-based complementary food, from which iron absorption \\ncan be as low as 5% (57), or with prolonged milk feeding (10, 58); and blood loss due to intestinal parasitic \\ninfections (59).\\nIn the preschool years, children undergo rapid growth, with an increase in red blood cells and high iron \\nrequirements (60). As children reach their third year, growth velocity decreases and daily iron requirements \\nmay decline. They are becoming ambulant and, if sanitation is poor, are more likely to acquire intestinal \\nparasitic infections that cause iron deficiency (61). Young children are being weaned from breastfeeding but \\nfoods being given may be inadequate for their iron needs (53).\\nAmong school-age children, iron deficiency has been associated with impaired cognitive and physical \\ndevelopment (20, 28), and provision of iron showed a positive effect  (44, 62, 63). However, a causal relation \\nbetween iron deficiency and cognitive impairment has not been confirmed (64). Assurance of cognitive and \\nphysical development though optimal nutrition in school-age children could have benefits beyond school \\nperformance (24).\\nNo increase in the incidence of respiratory infections has been found as a result of iron supplementation \\namong children (37–39, 65), although, in systematic review, there is evidence of a very slight increase in the \\nrisk of developing diarrhoea (at an estimated incidence rate difference of 0.05 episodes per child-year) (65). \\nIron supplementation in malaria-endemic areas\\nMalaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children in sub-Saharan Africa, with most infections \\ncaused by Plasmodium falciparum (66).  The effect of malaria on anaemia in areas of high transmission has \\nbeen observed to be less after 36 months of age (67, 68). At a very young age, children are somewhat less \\nvulnerable to malaria, owing to immunity passively acquired from their mothers, as well as lower exposure \\nto transmission (69, 70). Malaria infection is an important contributor to anaemia in endemic regions, \\nthrough direct haemolysis of infected red blood cells, the body’s immune destruction of both parasitized and \\nuninfected red blood cells, and temporary dysfunction of the bone marrow (71, 72).\\nIron is required for both regulation of immunity against infections and the survival and virulence of many \\npathogens (17, 73). One study reported a small decrease in the risk for mild clinical malaria in a cohort of \\nchildren in Kenya (74), while others have shown increased risk of malaria with iron interventions (49, 50).'),\n",

A further review was done on iron supplementation in children in malaria-\\nendemic areas,  based on an update of previous systematic reviews (79, 84). In all the reviews, iron was \\nadministered orally (excluding parenteral administration). All reviews searched the Cochrane Central Register \\nof Controlled Trials, Medline and Embase.

Heterogeneity in results was \\nnoted for the outcomes of anaemia and iron deficiency but was related to different beneficial effect \\nsizes rather than different effects. The effect sizes of the intervention on the outcomes were large. \\nThe evidence for morbidity and developmental outcomes is weak but the recommendation does not \\ndirectly address these outcomes.\\n• In cases where the population prevalence of anaemia is greater than 40%, the causes of anaemia are \\nmultifactorial and unlikely to be exclusively caused by iron deficiency. Even taking this into account, \\nmost children in most cases will benefit from iron supplementation in settings of high anaemia \\nprevalence.\\n• Not enough data are available on long-term harm, for instance on overdose, specifically for children \\nwho are iron replete.\\nDaily iron supplementation in children aged 24–59 months\\nSummary of the evidence\\nThe evidence that informed the recommendations on daily iron supplementation in children aged \\n24–59 months is based on a systematic review of trials involving children aged 2–5 years (46). The systematic \\nreview on the effects of daily iron supplementation in preschool-age children aged 2–5 years included 15 trials \\n(n =4212 children) (46).\\nOnly one trial reported on anaemia and none of the included trials reported on the other critical outcomes \\nof iron deficiency or iron deficiency anaemia specifically. However, ferritin, an indicator of iron stores and a \\nbiomarker for iron deficiency, was reported in five trials.

Additionally, haemoglobin, a biomarker \\nused to diagnose anaemia using age- and sex-specific cut-off values, was reported in nine trials. Children \\nreceiving daily iron supplementation had a higher mean haemoglobin concentration than those receiving \\nplacebo or supplementation without iron (MD: 6.97 g/L; 95% CI: 4.21 to 9.72; 9 trials, n = 2154). \\nThere were no differences between children receiving daily iron supplementation and those receiving a \\nplacebo or supplementation without iron, in terms of final height (MD: –0.1 Z-score; 95% CI: –1.14 to 0.12; 3 \\ntrials, n = 634) and final weight (MD: –0.04 Z-score; 95% CI: –0.12 to 0.05; 2 trials, n = 634).\\nThe quality of evidence for the critical outcomes was very low for anaemia and low for measures of physical \\ngrowth, using GRADE methodology (5, 85, 86).

Ideally, iron supplementation should be \\nimplemented as part of an integrated programme on child health, which includes addressing micronutrient \\ndeficiencies. \\nConsidering the actual experience of children and their caregivers with the intervention is also a relevant \\nimplementation consideration: ongoing assessment of the accessibility and acceptability of the intervention \\ncan inform programme design and development, in order to increase therapeutic adherence and better \\nassess the impact of the programme. This is particularly relevant in settings where the prevailing social norms \\nand determinants may set unequal conditions and opportunities for different groups. For instance, in some \\nsettings, gender norms may create unequal opportunities for girls and boys at any age, within and outside \\nof school; in other settings, social perceptions around ethnicity and race intervene in how certain population \\ngroups access and use an intervention. \\nFurthermore, intersectoral action is fundamental in those settings where the intervention is delivered in \\ncoordination with the education sector. The education sector is an important partner in the implementation \\nof the recommendation referring to school-age children. Appropriate coordination mechanisms and proper \\ntraining of health workers and education staff is necessary for delivery of the intervention and also for \\ncollection of data needed for programme monitoring and surveillance, including information on factors \\nrelated to health inequities.\\nSpecific efforts to increase the acceptability of the intervention to children and their caregivers are also \\nimportant. Greater acceptability and adoption are better achieved if they are accompanied by simple and \\neasy-to-access information that can be understood by different population groups, in a way that is culturally \\nappropriate and understandable. \\nAccessing hard-to-reach population groups is extremely important during implementation stages, as it \\ncontributes to preventing or tackling health inequities and to furthering the realization of children’s rights to \\nhealth. Appropriate surveillance and monitoring systems can thus provide information on the impact of the \\ndisseminated guidelines and their implementation (including information on the adequacy of funding and the \\neffectiveness of the supply chain and distribution channels). \\nRegulatory considerations\\nThe development of norms, standards and guidelines to promote quality assurance and quality control is a \\nresponsibility enshrined in WHO’s Constitution. Their development involves consultation with and input from \\nregulatory authorities in the country, including its national drug quality-control laboratories (91).\\nThe WHO Essential Medicines List (EML) compiles medicines that satisfy the priority health-care needs of \\npopulations and are selected with due regard to disease prevalence, evidence on efficacy and safety, and \\ncomparative cost-effectiveness (92). Hence, the WHO EML is used by countries for the development of their \\nown national essential medicines lists. The quality criteria for vitamins and minerals included in the WHO \\nEML should take into account WHO/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations standards (93).\\nUniversal access to essential medicines is part of the approach of universal health coverage and is used to \\nassess national commitment and progress towards the highest attainable standard of health.

Ethics is central to science, research, \\npolicy-making and implementation. Every field of human action, including public health nutrition, is subject to \\nfacing ethical challenges.\\nFour principles constitute the most widely accepted framework for ethics in medicine, and are used in other \\nhealth-related fields: (i) respect for individual autonomy; (ii) beneficence; (iii) non-maleficence; and (iv) justice. \\nThese principles assist health workers in identifying whether an intervention is producing benefits to individuals \\nand communities; preventing harms, also at the individual and societal levels; distributing health benefits across \\nsocial groups, i.e. how much an intervention is contributing to health equity; and respecting and promoting the \\nexercise of human rights.\\nThe delivery of micronutrients to infants and children with micronutrient deficiency is in line with the right \\nto health of children and with the aforementioned ethical principles. For this reason, an assessment of the \\nethical implications of implementing this intervention is pertinent in malaria-endemic settings, owing to the \\npossible interactions and potential adverse effects of increased iron intake by children affected by malaria. \\nChildren who live in malaria-endemic settings should indeed receive adequate iron. However, the provision of \\niron supplementation should be done in conjunction with public health measures to prevent, diagnose and treat \\nmalaria. Otherwise, a nutrition programme working in isolation and not coordinated with a malaria-prevention \\nand treatment programme may lead to unintentional harm, absence of benefit and increased health inequities.\\nCoordination with public health measures to prevent, diagnose and treat malaria is not just a sound \\nimplementation decision, but also an ethics-informed decision. Such coordination should comprise appropriate \\ntraining for health workers in public health nutrition, so they are knowledgeable of the particular requirements of \\nan iron-supplementation programme for infants and children that should be observed in malaria-endemic areas. \\nSuch training should also be provided to education staff co-working in the implementation of this intervention \\nin school-age children and educational settings.\\nThese considerations by no means imply that iron supplementation should not be provided to children in \\nmalaria-endemic settings. On the contrary, children in these settings should receive iron supplementation, \\ninasmuch as they suffer greater vulnerability to ill-health, including malnutrition. It requires, however, that \\nappropriate coordination between nutrition and malaria programmes is in place, so the intervention can \\nactually produce health benefits.\\nMonitoring and evaluation of guideline implementation\\nA plan for monitoring and evaluation with appropriate indicators, including equity-oriented indicators, is \\nencouraged at all stages (95). The impact of this guideline can be evaluated within countries (i.e. monitoring and \\nevaluation of the programmes implemented at national or regional scale) and across countries (i.e. adoption \\nand adaptation of the guideline globally). The WHO Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, \\nEvidence and Programme Guidance Unit, jointly with the United States Centers for Disease Control and \\nPrevention (CDC) International Micronutrient Malnutrition Prevention and Control (IMMPaCt) programme, and \\nwith input from international partners, has developed a generic logic model for micronutrient interventions in \\npublic health (96), to depict the plausible relationships between inputs and expected SDGs, by applying the \\nmicronutrient programme evaluation theory. Member States can adjust the model and use it in combination \\nwith appropriate indicators, for designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating the successful escalation \\nof nutrition actions in public health programmes. Additionally, the WHO/CDC eCatalogue of indicators for \\nmicronutrient programmes (97), which utilizes the logic model, has been developed as a user-friendly and \\nnon-comprehensive web resource for those actively engaged in providing technical assistance in monitoring,'),\n",

Indicators \\nfor iron supplementation are currently being developed and, once complete, will provide a list of potential \\nindicators with standard definitions that can be selected, downloaded and adapted to a local programme \\ncontext. The eCatalogue will serve as a repository of indicators to monitor and evaluate micronutrient \\ninterventions. While it does not provide guidance for designing or implementing a monitoring or evaluation \\nsystem in public health, some key indicators may include useful references for that purpose.\\nSince 1991, WHO has hosted the VMNIS micronutrients database (7). Part of WHO’s mandate is to assess \\nthe micronutrient status of populations, monitor and evaluate the impact of strategies for the prevention \\nand control of micronutrient malnutrition, and track related trends over time. The Evidence and Programme \\nGuidance Unit of the Department of Nutrition for Health and Development manages the VMNIS micronutrient \\ndatabase, through a network of regional and country offices, and in close collaboration with national health \\nauthorities.\\nFor evaluation at the global level, the WHO Department of Nutrition for Health and Development has \\ndeveloped a centralized platform for sharing information on nutrition actions in public health practice \\nimplemented around the world. By sharing programmatic details, specific country adaptations and \\nlessons learnt, this platform will provide examples of how guidelines are being translated into actions. The \\nGlobal database on the Implementation of Nutrition Action (GINA) (98) provides valuable information on the \\nimplementation of numerous nutrition policies and interventions. The use of GINA has grown steadily since its \\nlaunch in November 2012.\\nAn efficient system for the routine collection of relevant data, including relevant determinants of health, \\ntherapeutic adherence, and measures of programme performance, is critical to ensure supplementation \\nprogrammes are effective and sustained, and drivers to the achievement of the right to health for all population \\ngroups. Monitoring differences across groups in terms of accessibility, availability, acceptability and quality of \\nthe interventions contributes to the design of better public health programmes. The creation of indicators \\nfor monitoring can be informed by the approaches of social determinants of health (98), so inequities can be \\nidentified and tackled. It is particularly important to design sound implementation strategies to serve as the \\nbase for scaling up efforts. Appropriate monitoring requires suitable data, so efforts to collect and organize \\ninformation on the implementation are also fundamental.\\nGUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\\nThis guideline was developed in accordance with the WHO evidence-informed guideline-development \\nprocedures, as outlined in the WHO handbook for guideline development (4).\\nAdvisory groups\\nThe WHO Steering Committee for Nutrition Guidelines Development (see Annex 6), led by the Department \\nof Nutrition for Health and Development, was established in 2009 with representatives from all WHO \\ndepartments with an interest in the provision of scientific nutrition advice. The WHO Steering Committee for \\nNutrition Guidelines Development meets twice yearly and both guided and provided overall supervision of \\nthe guideline development process. Two additional groups were formed: a guideline development group and \\nan external review group.\\nTwo guideline development groups participated in the development of this guideline (see Annex 7). Their \\nrole was to advise WHO on the choice of important outcomes for decision-making and on interpretation \\nof the evidence.

Representatives of commercial organizations may \\nnot be members of a WHO guideline group.\\nThe final draft guideline was peer-reviewed by three content experts, who provided technical feedback. These \\npeer-reviewers (see Annex 8) were identified through various expert panels within and outside WHO (5, 85, \\n86, 101).\\nScope of the guideline, evidence appraisal and decision-making\\nAn initial set of questions (and the components of the questions) to be addressed in the guideline formed the \\ncritical starting point for formulating the recommendation. The questions were drafted by technical staff at \\nthe Evidence and Programme Guidance Unit, Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, based on \\nthe policy and programme guidance needs of Member States and their partners. The population, intervention, \\ncontrol, outcomes (PICO) format was used (see Annex 11). The questions were discussed and reviewed by \\nthe WHO Steering Committee for Nutrition Guidelines Development and the guideline development group – \\nnutrition actions, and were modified as needed.\\nA meeting of the guideline development group – nutrition actions was held on 14–16 March 2010, in Geneva, \\nSwitzerland, to finalize the scope of the questions and rank the outcomes and populations of interest for the \\nrecommendations on iron supplementation. The guideline development group discussed the relevance of the \\nquestions and modified them as needed. The group scored the relative importance of each outcome from 1 \\nto 9 (where 7–9 indicated that the outcome was critical for a decision, 4–6 indicated that it was important and \\n1–3 indicated that it was not important). The final key questions on this intervention, along with the outcomes \\nthat were identified as critical for decision-making, are listed in PICO format in Annex 11.\\nFour systematic reviews (46, 81, 82, 83) were used to summarize and appraise the evidence, using the \\nCochrane methodology (6) for randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Evidence summaries \\nwere prepared according to the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence (5, 85, 86, 101). \\nGRADE considers the study design; the limitations of the studies in terms of their conduct and analysis; the \\nconsistency of the results across the available studies; the directness (or applicability and external validity) of \\nthe evidence with respect to the populations, interventions and settings where the proposed intervention may \\nbe used; and the precision of the summary estimate of the effect.\\nBoth the systematic review and the GRADE evidence profiles for each of the critical outcomes were used for \\ndrafting this guideline. The draft recommendation was discussed by the WHO Steering Committee for Nutrition \\nGuidelines Development and in consultations with the WHO guideline development group – nutrition actions, \\nheld on 14–18 March 2011 and 23–26 June 2014 in Geneva, Switzerland.\\nThe procedures for decision-making are established at the beginning of the meetings, including a minimal set \\nof rules for agreement and decision-making documentation. At least two thirds of the guideline development \\ngroup should be present for an initial discussion of the evidence and proposed recommendation and \\nremarks. The members of the guideline development group secretly noted the direction and strength of \\nthe recommendation using a form designed for this purpose, which also included a section for documenting \\ntheir views on (i) the desirable and undesirable effects of the intervention; (ii) the quality of the available \\nevidence; (iii) values and preferences related to the intervention in different settings; and (iv) the cost of \\noptions available to health-care workers in different settings (see Annex 2). Each member used one form, \\nif not advised otherwise after managing any potential conflict of interests.

Subsequent deliberations among the members of the guideline development group were of private \\ncharacter. The WHO Secretariat collected the forms and disclosed a summary of the results to the guideline \\ndevelopment group. If there was no unanimous consensus (primary decision rule), more time was given for \\ndeliberations and a second round of online voting took place. If no unanimous agreement was reached, a two-\\nthirds vote of the guideline development group was required for approval of the proposed recommendation \\n(secondary decision rule). Divergent opinions could be recorded in the guideline. The results from voting \\nforms are kept on file by WHO for up to 5 years.

The responsible technical officer and the relevant \\ndepartments reviewed the declarations-of-interest statements for all guideline development group members \\nbefore finalization of the group composition and invitation to attend a guideline development group meeting. \\nAll members of the guideline development group, and participants of the guideline development meetings, \\nsubmitted a declaration of interests form, along with their curriculum vitae, before each meeting. Participants \\nof the guideline development group meetings participated in their individual capacity and not as institutional \\nrepresentatives. In addition, they verbally declared potential conflicts of interest at the beginning of each \\nmeeting. The procedures for management of competing interests strictly followed the WHO guidelines for \\ndeclaration of interests. The management of the perceived or real conflicts of interest declared by themembers \\nof the guideline group is summarized next.\\n1 \\nDr Beverley-Ann Biggs declared that the University of Melbourne received funding from the National Health \\nand Medical Research Council and Australian Research Council for research on intermittent iron and folic \\nacid supplementation in pregnancy, conducted in collaboration with the Research and Training Center for \\nCommunity Development, the Key Centre for Women’s Health and the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute. \\nIt was agreed that she could participate fully in the deliberations and decision-making on this guideline.\\nDr Luz Maria De-Regil declared that her present employer is an international nongovernmental organization \\ndevoted to the improvement of micronutrient status among infants, children and women. These activities are \\nprimarily financed by the government of Canada. The Micronutrient Initiative (MI) is a leading organization \\nworking exclusively to eliminate vitamin and mineral deficiencies in the world’s most vulnerable populations. \\nIt was decided that Dr De-Regil could be a member of the guideline development group and would disclose \\nher interests and the interests of her organization in the relevant guidelines related to micronutrient \\ninterventions. She participated in the deliberations related to recommendations for iron supplementation \\nbut recused herself from voting on this guideline.\\n1 A conflict-of-interest analysis must be performed whenever WHO relies on the independent advice of an expert in order to take a \\ndecision or to provide recommendations to Member States or other stakeholders. The term “conflict of interest” means any interest \\ndeclared by an expert that may affect, or be reasonably perceived to affect, the expert’s objectivity and independence in providing \\nadvice to WHO. WHO’s conflict-of-interest rules are designed to avoid potentially compromising situations that could undermine or \\notherwise affect the work of the expert, the committee or the activity in which the expert is involved, or WHO as a whole. Consequently, \\nthe scope of the inquiry is any interest that could reasonably be perceived to affect the functions that the expert is performing.'),\n",

SUMMARY OF THE CONSIDERATIONS OF THE MEMBERS OF THE GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT   \\nGROUP FOR DETERMINING THE STRENGTH OF THE RECOMMENDATION FOR DAILY IRON   \\nSUPPLEMENTATION IN CHILDREN AGED 6–23 MONTHS \\nQUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Iron deficiency anaemia had high-quality evidence. The \\nrecommendation addresses the outcomes targeted for \\nimprovement and for these outcomes the evidence is high, \\nbased on several randomized controlled trials. Heterogeneity \\nwas noted but was related to different beneficial effect sizes \\nrather than different effects. The effect sizes of the intervention \\non the outcomes were large. The evidence for morbidity and \\ndevelopmental outcomes is weak but the recommendation \\ndoes not directly address these outcomes.\\nVALUES AND PREFERENCES: In cases where the population prevalence of anaemia is greater \\nthan 40%, the causes of anaemia are multifactorial and unlikely \\nto be exclusively caused by iron deficiency. Even taking this \\ninto account, most children in most cases will benefit from \\nintermittent iron supplementation or daily supplementation.\\nIron-replete children might not gain from the intervention. \\nAcceptability might be an issue given associated side-effects \\n(gastrointestinal) and compliance may be difficult.\\nWhere access to health facilities is limited, as in many rural \\nareas, the problem may be more prevalent. Inequities in access \\nmay thus negatively affect successful implementation.\\nTRADE-OFF BETWEEN BENEFITS AND HARMS: Benefits include improved haemoglobin and lower risk of \\nanaemia, which have functional consequences. Potential \\nharms include diarrhoea, but evidence is low or very low or not \\nthoroughly evaluated for potential harms.\\nNot enough data are available on long-term harm, for instance \\non overdose, specifically for children who are iron replete. \\nCOSTS AND FEASIBILITY: Cost information was not presented but the cost of iron \\nsupplements is generally minor compared to the cost of the \\ndelivery platform and the need for strong behaviour change \\nand monitoring. Supplements are generally cheaper lipid-based \\nnutrient supplements.'),\n",

There is no clear \\nevidence regarding harms at proposed doses for diarrhoea and \\nother gastrointestinal effects, liver damage, insulin resistance \\nor iron overload\\nCOSTS AND FEASIBILITY: In well-established and well-functioning health-systems \\nsettings, the costs may be low. This may not be the case in low-\\nresource settings.

Control \\nof infectious diseases and malaria with insecticide-treated \\nbednets and vector control, and treatment of malaria episodes \\nwith effective antimalarial therapy, are critical components of \\nhealth care and should be instituted, together with promotion \\nof exclusive breastfeeding up to the age of 6 months, followed \\nby high-quality complementary feeding.\\nCOSTS AND FEASIBILITY: In the presence of comprehensive surveillance and prompt \\ndiagnosis and treatment of malaria, there was no compelling \\nevidence of increased risk of adverse events from iron \\nsupplementation.

While substantial progress has been made, countries need to \\nconsolidate and increase these advances, and to expand their agendas to go beyond survival, with a view to \\nmaximizing the health and potential of their populations.\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) envisions a world where every pregnant woman and newborn receives \\nquality care throughout the pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. Within the continuum of reproductive \\nhealth care, antenatal care (ANC) provides a platform for important health-care functions, including health \\npromotion, screening and diagnosis, and disease prevention. It has been established that by implementing timely \\nand appropriate evidence-based practices, ANC can save lives. Crucially, ANC also provides the opportunity to \\ncommunicate with and support women, families and communities at a critical time in the course of a woman’s \\nlife. The process of developing these recommendations on ANC has highlighted the importance of providing \\neffective communication about physiological, biomedical, behavioural and sociocultural issues, and effective \\nsupport, including social, cultural, emotional and psychological support, to pregnant women in a respectful way. \\nThese communication and support functions of ANC are key, not only to saving lives, but to improving lives, \\nhealth-care utilization and quality of care. Women’s positive experiences during ANC and childbirth can create \\nthe foundations for healthy motherhood.\\nThis is a comprehensive WHO guideline on routine ANC for pregnant women and adolescent girls. The aim is \\nfor these recommendations to complement existing WHO guidelines on the management of specific pregnancy-\\nrelated complications. The guidance is intended to reflect and respond to the complex nature of the issues \\nsurrounding the practice and delivery of ANC, and to prioritize person-centred health and well-being – not only \\nthe prevention of death and morbidity – in accordance with a human rights-based approach. \\nThe scope of this guideline was informed by a systematic review of women’s views, which shows that women \\nwant a positive pregnancy experience from ANC. A positive pregnancy experience is defined as maintaining \\nphysical and sociocultural normality, maintaining a healthy pregnancy for mother and baby (including preventing \\nor treating risks, illness and death), having an effective transition to positive labour and birth, and achieving \\npositive motherhood (including maternal self-esteem, competence and autonomy).\\nRecognizing that a woman’s experience of care is key to transforming ANC and creating thriving families and \\ncommunities, this guideline addresses the following questions:\\nnn What are the evidence-based practices during ANC that improve outcomes and lead to a positive pregnancy \\nexperience?\\nnn How should these practices be delivered? \\nGuideline development methods\\nThese ANC recommendations are intended to inform the development of relevant health-care policies and \\nclinical protocols. The guideline was developed using standard operating procedures in accordance with the \\nprocess described in the WHO handbook for guideline development. Briefly, these procedures include:  \\n(i) identification of priority questions and outcomes; (ii) evidence retrieval and synthesis; (iii) assessment of \\nthe evidence; (iv) formulation of the recommendations; and (v) planning for implementation, dissemination, \\nimpact evaluation and updating of the guideline. The quality of the scientific evidence underpinning the \\nrecommendations was graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and'),\n",

The DECIDE (Developing and Evaluating Communication \\nStrategies to support Informed Decisions and Practice based on Evidence) framework, an evidence-to-decision \\ntool that includes intervention effects, values, resources, equity, acceptability and feasibility criteria, was used \\nto guide the formulation and approval of recommendations by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) – an \\ninternational group of experts assembled for the purpose of developing this guideline – at three T echnical \\nConsultations between October 2015 and March 2016.\\nRecommendations\\nThe WHO T echnical Consultations led to the development of 39 recommendations related to five types \\nof interventions: A. Nutritional interventions, B. Maternal and fetal assessment, C. Preventive measures, \\nD.\\xa0Interventions for common physiological symptoms, and E. Health system interventions to improve utilization \\nand quality of ANC. Interventions were either recommended, not recommended, or recommended under certain \\nconditions based on the GDG’s judgements according to the DECIDE criteria, which informed both the direction \\nand context, if any, of the recommendation. T o ensure that each recommendation is correctly understood \\nand applied in practice, the context of all context-specific recommendations is clearly stated within each \\nrecommendation, and the contributing experts provided additional remarks where needed. Users of the guideline \\nshould refer to these remarks, which are presented along with the evidence summaries within the guideline. In \\naddition, ANC-relevant recommendations from current guidance produced by other WHO departments were \\nsystematically identified and 10 such recommendations were consolidated into this guideline for the purpose of \\nproviding a comprehensive document for end-users. All 49 recommendations on ANC for a positive pregnancy \\nexperience are summarized in T able 1. \\nIn accordance with WHO guideline development standards, these recommendations will be reviewed and \\nupdated following the identification of new evidence, with major reviews and updates at least every five years. \\nWHO welcomes suggestions regarding additional questions for inclusion in future updates of the guideline.\\nAt the T echnical Consultations, the implementation considerations of individual recommendations and of the \\nguideline as a whole were discussed. The GDG, emphasizing the evidence indicating increased fetal deaths and \\nlesser satisfaction of women with the four-visit model (also known as focused or basic ANC), decided to increase \\nthe recommended number of contacts between the mother and the health-care providers at time points that may \\nfacilitate assessment of well-being and provision of interventions to improve outcomes if problems are identified \\n(see Recommendation E.7 in T able 1). The recommendations in this guideline should be implemented alongside \\nother quality-improvement activities. Derivative products of this guideline will include a practical implementation \\nmanual for health-care practitioners, which will incorporate ANC recommendations and established good \\nclinical practices. T able 1 summarizes the list of all interventions evaluated by the GDG and therefore includes \\ninterventions that are recommended, only recommended under certain conditions (including research), and \\ninterventions that are not recommended.'),\n",

Introduction\\n1.\\u2002Introduction\\n1.1 Background\\nInternational human rights law includes fundamental \\ncommitments of states to enable women and \\nadolescent girls to survive pregnancy and childbirth \\nas part of their enjoyment of sexual and reproductive \\nhealth and rights and living a life of dignity (1). The \\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) envisions a world \\nwhere “every pregnant woman and newborn receives \\nquality care throughout the pregnancy, childbirth and \\nthe postnatal period” (2). However, approximately \\n303\\xa0000 women and adolescent girls died as a result \\nof pregnancy and childbirth-related complications in \\n2015 (3). Around 99% of maternal deaths occur in \\nlow-resource settings and most can be prevented\\xa0(4). \\nSimilarly, approximately 2.6 million babies were \\nstillborn in 2015, also mainly in low-resource \\nsettings\\xa0(5). Nevertheless, there is evidence that \\neffective interventions exist at reasonable cost for the \\nprevention or treatment of virtually all life-threatening \\nmaternal complications (6), and almost two thirds \\nof the global maternal and neonatal disease burden \\ncould be alleviated through optimal adaptation and \\nuptake of existing research findings (7). But a human \\nrights-based approach is not just about avoiding \\ndeath and morbidity – it is about enabling health and \\nwell-being while respecting dignity and rights.\\nAntenatal care (ANC) can be defined as the care \\nprovided by skilled health-care professionals to \\npregnant women and adolescent girls in order to \\nensure the best health conditions for both mother \\nand baby during pregnancy. The components of \\nANC include: risk identification; prevention and \\nmanagement of pregnancy-related or concurrent \\ndiseases; and health education and health promotion.\\nANC reduces maternal and perinatal morbidity \\nand mortality both directly, through detection and \\ntreatment of pregnancy-related complications, and \\nindirectly, through the identification of women and \\ngirls at increased risk of developing complications \\nduring labour and delivery, thus ensuring referral \\nto an appropriate level of care (8). In addition, as \\nindirect causes of maternal morbidity and mortality, \\nsuch as HIV and malaria infections, contribute \\nto approximately 25% of maternal deaths and \\nnear-misses (9), ANC also provides an important \\nopportunity to prevent and manage concurrent \\ndiseases through integrated service delivery (10).\\nIn low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), ANC \\nutilization has increased since the introduction in \\n2002 of the WHO ANC model, known as focused \\nANC (FANC) or basic ANC, which is a goal-\\norientated approach to delivering evidence-based \\ninterventions carried out at four critical times during \\npregnancy (11, 12). However, globally, during the \\nperiod 2007–2014, only 64% of pregnant women \\nattended the WHO-recommended minimum four \\ncontacts for ANC, suggesting that much more work \\nneeds to be done to address ANC utilization and \\nquality.\\nCurrently, WHO guidance on routine ANC is \\nfragmented, with related recommendations published \\nacross several different WHO guidelines and \\npractical manuals. The 2002 FANC implementation \\nmanual, for example (12), does not contain relevant \\ncontext-specific guidance, which needs to be sought \\nelsewhere. In addition, evidence on the possible harm \\nof the FANC model has recently become available, \\nnecessitating a review.\\nThis up-to-date, consolidated guideline for routine \\nANC has been produced by the WHO Department \\nof Reproductive Health and Research (RHR), in \\ncollaboration with the Department of Nutrition for \\nHealth and Development (NHD) and the Department \\nof Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health \\n(MCA), as part of WHO’s normative work on \\nsupporting evidence-informed policies and practices. \\nBy reviewing, updating and bringing together ANC-\\nrelated WHO recommendations regarding “what” \\nshould be offered and “how” it should be delivered \\nin the form of this guideline, it is hoped that policy-\\nmakers will more easily be able to adapt, adopt \\nand implement these new ANC recommendations, \\npresented in Chapter 3, which have also been \\nconfigured to form the 2016 WHO ANC model, \\npresented in Chapter 4.\\nA scoping review was conducted to inform this \\nguideline, and it revealed that what women want and'),\n",

Thus, the management \\nof women and adolescent girls with high-risk \\npregnancies is beyond the scope of this ANC \\nguideline, which is aimed at providing guidance \\non routine ANC.

Of the 15 related to \\nroutine ANC, three were issued by WHO (19–21), \\nwhile the rest were issued by governmental and \\nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Australia, \\nCanada, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Poland, the United \\nKingdom and the United States of America (USA). \\nSimilarly, of the 70 guidelines related to specific \\nsituations relevant to ANC, 91% were from Canada, \\nthe United Kingdom and the USA, i.e.\\xa0high-income \\ncountries (HICs), while low- and middle-income \\ncountries (LMICs) were poorly represented. An \\nexisting, recent, up-to-date guideline relevant to \\nroutine ANC that was adaptable to different resource \\nsettings was not identified. This scoping exercise \\nalso informed the choice of outcomes for the ANC \\nguideline, which was supplemented by outcomes \\nidentified by a preliminary search of the Cochrane \\nDatabase of Systematic Reviews for existing key \\nsystematic reviews relevant to the antenatal period.\\nBased on these initial steps, the WHO Steering Group \\ndeveloped a framework for discussion at a scoping \\nmeeting, held in Geneva in April 2014, to identify \\npriority questions about the provision of ANC as \\nwell as to inform the scoping for the guideline in \\nterms of approach, focus, questions and outcomes. \\nAt this meeting, it was decided that the scope of \\nthis guideline should prioritize the applicability of \\ninterventions in LMIC settings. Specific genetic tests \\nfor detection of inherited conditions were considered \\nbeyond the scope of this guideline. In addition, the \\nscoping process highlighted the need to identify \\nwomen-centred interventions and outcomes for \\nANC. T o this end, a qualitative systematic review was \\nconducted to understand what women want, need \\nand value in pregnancy and ANC (22). The findings \\nof this systematic review suggested that the primary \\noutcome for pregnant women is a “positive pregnancy \\nexperience” (as defined in section 1.1), which \\nrequires the provision of effective clinical practices \\n(interventions and tests), relevant and timely \\ninformation, and psychosocial and emotional support \\nby practitioners with good clinical and interpersonal \\nskills, within a well functioning health system.

Therefore, the overarching \\nquestions addressed by this guideline focused on the \\nfollowing:\\nnn What are the evidence-based practices during the \\nANC period for improving outcomes related to the \\nfollowing?\\nn– nutritional interventions (see section 3.A)\\nn– maternal and fetal assessment (see section 3.B)\\nn– preventive measures (see section 3.C)\\nn– interventions for common physiological \\nsymptoms (see section 3.D)\\nnn How should these evidence-based practices be \\ndelivered to improve outcomes?\\nn– health systems interventions to improve the \\nutilization and quality of ANC (see section 3.E).\\nThe guideline focuses on the core ANC clinical \\npackage that all women should receive at routine \\nANC visits.

Methods\\nStudies scoring D were excluded on grounds of poor \\nquality.\\nThe findings of the qualitative reviews were appraised \\nfor quality using the GRADE-CERQual tool (16, 26). \\nThe GRADE-CERQual tool, which uses a similar \\napproach conceptually to other GRADE tools, \\nprovides a transparent method for assessing and \\nassigning the level of confidence that can be placed \\nin evidence from reviews of qualitative research. The \\nqualitative review team used the GRADE-CERQual \\ntool to assess the confidence in qualitative review \\nfindings, which were assigned to evidence domains \\non values, acceptability and feasibility according to \\nfour components: methodological limitations of the \\nindividual studies, adequacy of data, coherence and \\nrelevance to the review question of the individual \\nstudies contributing to a review finding.\\n2.11 Formulation of the recommendations\\nThe Steering Group supervised and finalized the \\npreparation of evidence summaries and evidence \\nprofiles in collaboration with the guideline \\nmethodologists, using the DECIDE framework (17). \\nDECIDE is an evidence-to-decision (EtD) tool that \\nincludes explicit and systematic consideration of \\nevidence on interventions in terms of six domains: \\neffects, values, resources, equity, acceptability and \\nfeasibility. For each priority question, judgements \\nare made on the impact of the intervention on each \\nof these domains, in order to inform and guide \\nthe decision-making process. Using the DECIDE \\nframework, the Steering Group created summary \\ndocuments for each priority question covering \\nevidence on each of the six domains.\\nnn Effects: The evidence on maternal and perinatal \\noutcomes was described. Where benefits clearly \\noutweighed harms, or vice versa, there was a \\ngreater likelihood of a clear judgement in favour \\nof or against the option, respectively. Uncertainty \\nabout the net benefits or harms and small net \\nbenefits often led to a judgement that neither \\nfavoured the intervention nor the comparator. The \\nhigher the certainty of evidence on benefits across \\noutcomes, the higher the likelihood of a judgement \\nin favour of the intervention.\\nnn Values: This relates to the relative importance \\nassigned to the outcomes of the intervention by \\nthose affected by them, how such importance \\nvaries within and across settings, and whether this \\nimportance is surrounded by any uncertainty. A \\nscoping review of what women want from ANC \\ninformed the ANC guideline (13). Evidence showed \\nthat women from high-, middle- and low-resource \\nsettings generally valued having a “positive \\npregnancy experience” achieved through three \\nequally important ANC components – effective \\nclinical practices (interventions and tests), relevant \\nand timely information, and psychosocial and \\nemotional support – each provided by practitioners \\nwith good clinical and interpersonal skills within \\na well functioning health system. Reviewers \\nhad high confidence in the evidence. Therefore, \\ninterventions that facilitated this composite \\noutcome were more likely to lead to a judgement in \\nfavour of the intervention.\\nnn Resources: The most relevant resources in \\nthe context of the implementation of the ANC \\ninterventions in this guideline mainly included \\ncosts for providing medicines, supplies, equipment \\nand skilled human resources. A judgement in \\nfavour or against the intervention was likely \\nwhere the resource implications were clearly \\nadvantageous or disadvantageous. Cost evaluation \\nrelied on reported estimates obtained during \\nthe evidence retrieval process, a 2013 treatment \\nassumption report (27), the WHO compendium \\nof innovative health technologies for low-resource \\nsettings (28), as well as experiences and opinions \\nof the GDG members. It was recognized that \\nactual costing of interventions is context-specific \\nand not feasible for a global guideline.\\nnn Equity: This section was informed by the 2015 \\nWHO report on inequalities in reproductive, \\nmaternal, newborn and child health, which \\nshowed that women in LMICs who are poor, least \\neducated, and residing in rural areas have lower \\nANC coverage and worse pregnancy outcomes \\nthan the more advantaged women in LMICs (29). \\nTheir neonates also have worse health outcomes. \\nTherefore, judgements were more likely to favour \\nthe interventions if they could reduce health \\ndifferences among different groups of women and \\ntheir families.\\nnn Acceptability: Qualitative evidence from the \\nsystematic reviews on women's and providers’ \\nviews informed judgements for this domain. The \\nlower the acceptability, the lower the likelihood of \\na judgement in favour of the intervention.\"),\n",

Nutritional interventions\\nBackground\\nPregnancy requires a healthy diet that includes \\nan adequate intake of energy, protein, vitamins \\nand minerals to meet maternal and fetal needs. \\nHowever, for many pregnant women, dietary intake \\nof vegetables, meat, dairy products and fruit is often \\ninsufficient to meet these needs, particularly in low- \\nand middle-income countries (LMICs) where multiple \\nnutritional deficiencies often co-exist. In resource-\\npoor countries in sub-Saharan Africa, south-central \\nand south-east Asia, maternal undernutrition is highly \\nprevalent and is recognized as a key determinant of \\npoor perinatal outcomes (31). However, obesity and \\noverweight is also associated with poor pregnancy \\noutcomes and many women in a variety of settings \\ngain excessive weight during pregnancy. While \\nobesity has historically been a condition associated \\nwith affluence, there is some evidence to suggest a \\nshift in the burden of overweight and obesity from \\nadvantaged to disadvantaged populations (32).\\nAnaemia is associated with iron, folate and vitamin \\nA deficiencies. It is estimated to affect 38.2% of \\npregnant women globally, with the highest prevalence \\nin the WHO regions of South-East Asia (48.7%) and \\nAfrica (46.3%), medium prevalence in the Eastern \\nMediterranean Region (38.9%) and the lowest \\nprevalence in the WHO regions of the Western \\nPacific (24.3%), the Americas (24.9%) and Europe \\n(25.8%) (33).\\nMajor contributory factors to anaemia include \\nparasitic infections such as malaria, hookworm and \\nschistosomiasis, in areas where these infections \\nare endemic. In addition, chronic infections such as \\ntuberculosis (TB) and HIV, and haemoglobinopathies \\nsuch as sickle-cell disease, contribute to the \\nprevalence of anaemia. It is estimated that 0.8\\xa0million \\npregnant women globally have severe anaemia \\n(defined as a blood haemoglobin concentration \\n<\\xa070\\xa0g/L) (33). In pregnancy, severe anaemia is \\nassociated with an increased risk of maternal and \\ninfant mortality (34). It is estimated that about half of \\nthe anaemia found in pregnant women is amenable \\nto iron supplementation (33); however, this may \\nbe quite variable and is likely to be much lower in \\nmalaria-endemic areas.\\nIn addition to causing anaemia, iron deficiency \\nadversely affects the use of energy sources by \\nmuscles and, thus, physical capacity and work \\nperformance, and also adversely affects immune \\nstatus and morbidity from infections (35). Folate \\n(vitamin\\xa0B9) deficiency, in addition to anaemia it is \\nalso linked to fetal neural tube defects (36). Vitamin\\xa0A \\ndeficiency affects about 19\\xa0million pregnant women, \\nmostly in Africa and South-East Asia, causing night \\nblindness (37).\\nCalcium deficiency is associated with an increased \\nrisk of pre-eclampsia (38), and deficiencies of other \\nvitamins and minerals, such as vitamin E, C, B6 and \\nzinc, have also been postulated to play a role in \\npre-eclampsia. Zinc deficiency is associated with \\nimpaired immunity (39). Vitamin C intake enhances \\niron absorption from the gut; however, zinc, iron \\nand other mineral supplements may compete \\nfor absorption, and it is unclear whether such \\ninteractions have health consequences (39).\\nFor the ANC guideline, the GDG evaluated the \\nevidence on various vitamin and mineral supplements \\nthat might theoretically lead to improved maternal \\nand perinatal outcomes. In addition, as both \\nundernourishment and overnourishment may have \\nnegative consequences for pregnant women and \\ntheir babies, the GDG also evaluated evidence on \\nthe effects of various dietary interventions to reduce \\nthe impact of these conditions. Caffeine is possibly \\nthe most widely used psychoactive substance in the \\nworld (40), and the GDG also evaluated evidence \\non the impact, if any, of caffeine restriction during \\npregnancy.'),\n",

Evidence and recommendations \\n15\\nA.1: Dietary interventions\\nA1.1: Counselling on healthy eating and physical activity\\nRECOMMENDATION A.1.1: Counselling about healthy eating and keeping physically active \\nduring pregnancy is recommended for pregnant women to stay healthy and to prevent excessive \\nweight gain during pregnancy. (Recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• A healthy diet contains adequate energy, protein, vitamins and minerals, obtained through the \\nconsumption of a variety of foods, including green and orange vegetables, meat, fish, beans, nuts, whole \\ngrains and fruit (41).\\n• Stakeholders may wish to consider culturally appropriate healthy eating and exercise interventions \\nto prevent excessive weight gain in pregnancy, particularly for populations with a high prevalence of \\noverweight and obesity, depending on resources and women’s preferences. Interventions should be \\nwoman-centred and delivered in a non-judgemental manner, and developed to ensure appropriate weight \\ngain (see further information in points below).\\n• A healthy lifestyle includes aerobic physical activity and strength-conditioning exercise aimed at \\nmaintaining a good level of fitness throughout pregnancy, without trying to reach peak fitness level or \\ntrain for athletic competition. Women should choose activities with minimal risk of loss of balance and \\nfetal trauma (42).\\n• Most normal gestational weight gain occurs after 20 weeks of gestation and the definition of “normal” is \\nsubject to regional variations, but should take into consideration pre-pregnant body mass index (BMI). \\nAccording to the Institute of Medicine classification (43), women who are underweight at the start of \\npregnancy (i.e. BMI <\\xa018.5\\xa0kg/ m\\n2) should aim to gain 12.5–18\\xa0kg, women who are normal weight at the \\nstart of pregnancy (i.e. BMI 18.5–24.9\\xa0kg/ m2) should aim to gain 11.5–16\\xa0kg, overweight women (i.e. BMI \\n25–29.9\\xa0k g /m2) should aim to gain 7–11.5\\xa0kg, and obese women(i.e. BMI >\\xa030\\xa0kg/ m2) should aim to gain \\n5–9\\xa0kg.\\n• Most evidence on healthy eating and exercise interventions comes from high-income countries (HICs), \\nand the GDG noted that that there are at least 40 ongoing trials in HICs in this field. The GDG noted that \\nresearch is needed on the effects, feasibility and acceptability of healthy eating and exercise interventions \\nin LMICs.\\n• Pregnancy may be an optimal time for behaviour change interventions among populations with a high \\nprevalence of overweight and obesity, and the longer-term impact of these interventions on women, \\nchildren and partners needs investigation.\\n• The GDG noted that a strong training package is needed for practitioners, including standardized \\nguidance on nutrition. This guidance should be evidence-based, sustainable, reproducible, accessible and \\nadaptable to different cultural settings.\\nWomen’s values\\nA scoping review of what women want from ANC and what outcomes they value informed the ANC guideline (13). \\nEvidence showed that women from high-, medium- and low-resource settings valued having a positive pregnancy \\nexperience, the components of which included the provision of effective clinical practices (interventions and tests, \\nincluding nutritional supplements), relevant and timely information (including dietary and nutritional advice) and \\npsychosocial and emotional support, by knowledgeable, supportive and respectful health-care practitioners, to \\noptimize maternal and newborn health (high confidence in the evidence).'),\n",

Thirty-four \\ntrials recruited women from the general population \\n(i.e. women of a wide range of BMIs at baseline), \\n24 trials recruited overweight and/ or obese women \\nand seven recruited women defined as being at \\nhigh risk of gestational diabetes. In total, 49 RCT s \\ninvolving 11\\xa0444 women contributed data to the \\nreview’s meta-analyses. Diet interventions were \\ndefined as a special selection of food or energy \\nintake to which a participant was restricted, which \\nwere most commonly “healthy eating” types of diets. \\nExercise interventions were defined by reviewers as \\nany activity requiring physical effort, carried out to \\nsustain or improve health or fitness, and these were \\neither prescribed/unsupervised (e.g. 30 minutes of \\ndaily walking), supervised (e.g. a weekly supervised \\ngroup exercise class) or both. These interventions \\nwere usually compared with “standard ANC” and \\naimed to prevent excessive gestational weight gain \\n(EGWG).\\nMost trials recruited women between 10 and 20 \\nweeks of gestation. There was substantial variation \\nin the number of contacts (i.e. counselling/ exercise \\nsessions), type of intervention and method of \\ndelivery. Data were grouped according to the type \\nof intervention (i.e. diet only, exercise only, diet and \\nexercise counselling, diet and supervised exercise) \\nand the average effects across trials were estimated \\nusing the random effects model. Separate analyses \\nwere performed according to type of intervention and \\nthe risk of weight-related complications. Most data \\nin the overall analyses were derived from trials of \\ncombined diet and exercise interventions.\\nMaternal outcomes\\nHigh-certainty evidence shows that women receiving \\ndiet and/ or exercise interventions as part of ANC to \\nprevent EGWG are less likely to experience EGWG \\n(24 trials, 7096 women; relative risk [RR]: 0.80, \\n95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73–0.87; absolute \\neffect of 91 fewer women with EGWG per 1000 on \\naverage).

However, the \\noptimal cut-off points may need to be determined for individual countries based on context-specific cost–\\nbenefit analyses (31).\\n• Establishment of a quality assurance process is important to guarantee that balanced energy and \\nprotein food supplements are manufactured, packaged and stored in a controlled and uncontaminated \\nenvironment. The cost and logistical implications associated with balanced energy and protein \\nsupplements might be mitigated by local production of supplements, provided that a quality assurance \\nprocess is established.\\n• A continual, adequate supply of supplements is required for programme success. This requires a clear \\nunderstanding and investment in procurement and supply chain management.\\n• Programmes should be designed and continually improved based on locally generated data and \\nexperiences. Examples relevant to this guideline include:\\n – Improving delivery, acceptability and utilization of this intervention by pregnant women (i.e. \\novercoming supply and utilization barriers).\\n – Distribution of balanced energy and protein supplements may not be feasible only through the \\nlocal schedule of ANC visits; additional visits may need to be scheduled. The costs related to these \\nadditional visits should be considered. In the absence of antenatal visits, too few visits, or when the \\nfirst visit comes too late, consideration should be given to alternative platforms for delivery (e.g. \\ncommunity health workers, task shifting in specific settings).\\n – Values and preferences related to the types and amounts of balanced energy and protein supplements \\nmay vary.\\n• Monitoring and evaluation should include evaluation of household-level storage facilities, spoilage, \\nwastage, retailing, sharing and other issues related to food distribution.\\n• Each country will need to understand the context-specific etiology of undernutrition at the national and \\nsub-national levels.

(Context-specific recommendation)\\nRemarks\\n• This recommendation is consistent with the 2011 WHO recommendations for prevention and treatment of \\npre-eclampsia and eclampsia (57) (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) and supersedes \\nthe WHO recommendation found in the 2013 Guideline: calcium supplementation in pregnant women (38).\\n• Dietary counselling of pregnant women should promote adequate calcium intake through locally \\navailable, calcium-rich foods.\\n• Dividing the dose of calcium may improve acceptability. The suggested scheme for calcium \\nsupplementation is 1.5–2\\xa0g daily, with the total dose divided into three doses, preferably taken at \\nmealtimes.\\n• Negative interactions between iron and calcium supplements may occur. Therefore, the two nutrients \\nshould preferably be administered several hours apart rather than concomitantly (38).\\n• As there is no clear evidence on the timing of initiation of calcium supplementation, stakeholders may \\nwish to commence supplementation at the first ANC visit, given the possibility of compliance issues.\\n• T o reach the most vulnerable populations and ensure a timely and continuous supply of supplements, \\nstakeholders may wish to consider task shifting the provision of calcium supplementation in community \\nsettings with poor access to health-care professionals (see Recommendation E.6.1, in section E: Health \\nsystems interventions to improve the utilization and quality of ANC).\\n• The implementation and impact of this recommendation should be monitored at the health service, \\nregional and country levels, based on clearly defined criteria and indicators associated with locally agreed \\ntargets. Successes and failures should be evaluated to inform integration of this recommendation into the \\nANC package.\\n• Further WHO guidance on prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia is \\navailable in the 2011 WHO recommendations (57), available at: http:/ / apps.who.int/iris/\\nbitstream/10665/ 44703/1/9789241548335_eng.pdf\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of calcium supplements compared \\nwith no calcium supplements (for outcomes \\nother than hypertension/ pre-eclampsia) \\n(EB\\xa0T able\\xa0A.3)\\nEvidence on the effects of calcium supplements on \\noutcomes other than hypertension/ pre-eclampsia \\nwas derived from a Cochrane systematic review (58). \\nThe review included data from 23 trials involving \\n18\\xa0587 pregnant women.

There \\nis a separate Cochrane review on the latter (59), \\nwhich has been referenced to support existing WHO \\nrecommendations on calcium supplementation to \\nprevent pre-eclampsia in populations with low dietary \\ncalcium intake (38, 57).\\nIn 14 trials, daily calcium doses ranged from \\n1000\\xa0mg to 2000\\xa0mg, and in the remainder it was \\nless than 1000\\xa0mg. Eleven trials started calcium \\nsupplementation at or after 20 weeks of gestation, \\nfive trials started before 20 weeks, and the rest did \\nnot specify when supplementation was initiated.

(Context-specific recommendation)\\nRemarks\\n• Pregnant women should be informed that a high daily caffeine intake (> 300 mg per day) is probably \\nassociated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss and low birth weight.\\n• Caffeine is a stimulant found in tea, coffee, soft-drinks, chocolate, kola nuts and some over-the-counter \\nmedicines. Coffee is probably the most common source of high caffeine intake. A cup of instant coffee \\ncan contain about 60 mg of caffeine; however, some commercially brewed coffee brands contain more \\nthan 150 mg of caffeine per serving.\\n• Caffeine-containing teas (black tea and green tea) and soft drinks (colas and iced tea) usually contain \\nless than 50\\xa0mg per 250 mL serving.\\na This includes any product, beverage or food containing caffeine (i.e. brewed coffee, tea, cola-type soft drinks, caffeinated energy drinks, chocolate, caffeine \\ntablets).\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\na) Effects of decaffeinated coffee versus \\ncaffeinated coffee (RCT evidence) (EB \\nT able\\xa0A.10a)\\nSome evidence on the effects of caffeine intake \\nwas derived from a Cochrane review that included \\ntwo RCT s (40). Only one of the trials, conducted in \\nDenmark, contributed evidence. In this trial, 1207 \\npregnant women drinking more than three cups of \\ncoffee a day were randomized to receive instant \\ndecaffeinated coffee (intervention group) versus \\ninstant caffeinated coffee (control group) in order \\nto assess the effect of caffeine reduction during \\npregnancy. In this trial, a cup of caffeinated coffee \\nwas estimated to contain 65 mg caffeine. Other \\nsources of caffeine, such as cola, tea and chocolate \\nwere not restricted. Mean daily caffeine intake in \\nthe decaffeinated coffee group was 117 mg per day \\n(interquartile range [IQR]: 56–228 mg) compared \\nwith 317 mg per day (IQR: 229–461 mg) in the \\ncaffeinated coffee group.\\nMaternal outcomes\\nNone of the maternal outcomes addressed in the \\nANC guideline were reported in the review.\\nFetal and neonatal outcomes\\nLow-certainty evidence from one trial shows that \\nrestricting caffeine intake (replacing caffeinated \\ncoffee with decaffeinated coffee) may have little or \\nno effect on SGA (1150 neonates; RR: 0.97, 95% CI: \\n0.57–1.64), mean birth weight (1197 neonates; MD: \\n20.00, 95% CI: –48.68 to 88.68) and preterm birth \\n(1153 neonates; RR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.48–1.37).\\nNo data were available on congenital anomalies or \\nperinatal mortality.\\nb) Effects of high caffeine intake versus \\nmoderate, low or no caffeine intake (non-\\nrandomized study evidence) (EB T able A.10b)\\nThe GDG considered the evidence from RCT s to be \\ninsufficient to make a recommendation on caffeine \\nrestriction and additional evidence from reviews of \\nnon-randomized studies (NRSs) was thus evaluated. \\nT wo NRS reviews asked the question, “Is there an \\nassociation between maternal caffeine intake and the \\nrisk of low birth weight?” (77, 78), and two reviews \\nasked the question “Is there an association between \\nmaternal caffeine intake and the risk of pregnancy \\nloss?” (79, 80). In these reviews, low caffeine intake \\nwas defined as less than 150\\xa0mg caffeine per day, \\nand high caffeine intake was defined as more than \\n300\\xa0mg or more than 350\\xa0mg per day. All four reviews \\nadjusted data for smoking and other variables, and \\nperformed dose–response meta-analyses.\\nFetal and neonatal outcomes: low birth weight\\nModerate-certainty evidence from one review shows \\nthat high caffeine intake (more than 300\\xa0mg) is \\nprobably associated with a greater risk of low birth \\nweight than low or no caffeine intake (12 studies; \\nodds ratio [OR]: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.10–1.73) (78). Very \\nlow- to moderate-certainty evidence from the other \\nreview was stratified according to dose and shows \\nthat very low caffeine intake may be associated with \\nfewer low-birth-weight neonates than low (5 studies; \\nRR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06–1.21), moderate (7 studies; RR: \\n1.38, 95% CI: 1.18–1.62) or high caffeine intake (8 \\nstudies; RR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.24–2.08) (77).'),\n",

Maternal and fetal assessment\\nB.1: Maternal assessment\\nBackground\\nHypertensive disorders of pregnancy are important \\ncauses of maternal and perinatal morbidity and \\nmortality, with approximately a quarter of maternal \\ndeaths and near misses estimated to be due to pre-\\neclampsia and eclampsia (9). Antenatal screening \\nfor pre-eclampsia is an essential part of good ANC. \\nIt is routinely performed by measuring maternal \\nblood pressure and checking for proteinuria at each \\nANC contact and, upon detection of pre-eclampsia, \\nspecific management is required to prevent eclampsia \\nand other poor maternal and perinatal outcomes \\n(57). The GDG did not evaluate evidence or make a \\nrecommendation on this procedure, therefore, which \\nit considers to be an essential component of Good \\nClinical Practice in ANC.\\nAs part of the ANC guideline development, \\nspecifically in relation to maternal assessment, \\nthe GDG considered evidence and other relevant \\ninformation on interventions to detect the following \\nconditions in pregnancy:\\nnn Anaemia: Defined as a blood haemoglobin (Hb) \\nconcentration below 110\\xa0g/L, anaemia is the \\nworld’s second leading cause of disability, and one \\nof the most serious global public health problems, \\nwith the global prevalence of anaemia among \\npregnant women at about 38% (33). Clinical \\nassessment (inspection of the conjunctiva for \\npallor) is a common method of detecting anaemia \\nbut has been shown to be quite inaccurate. \\nIn HICs, performing a full blood count, which \\nquantifies the blood Hb level, is part of routine \\nANC (81). However, this and other available \\ntests may be expensive, complex or impractical \\nfor use in rural or LMIC settings. A low-cost and \\nreliable method of detecting anaemia is therefore \\nneeded for places with no or limited access \\nto laboratory facilities. WHO developed the \\nhaemoglobin colour scale, a low-cost method that \\nis performed by placing a drop of undiluted blood \\non specially made chromatography paper and \\nmatching it against a range of colours representing \\ndifferent Hb values in 20\\xa0g/L increments (82). \\nWith haemoglobinometer tests, undiluted blood \\nis placed directly into a microcuvette, which \\nis inserted into the haemoglobinometer (or \\nphotometer) to produce a reading (82).\\nnn Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB): ASB is a \\ncommon urinary tract condition that is associated \\nwith an increased risk of urinary tract infections \\n(cystitis and pyelonephritis) in pregnant women. \\nEscherichia coli is associated with up to 80% \\nof isolates; other pathogens include Klebsiella \\nspecies, Proteus mirabilis and group B streptococcus \\n(GBS) (83). Methods for diagnosing ASB include \\nmidstream urine culture (the gold standard), Gram \\nstain and urine dipstick tests. A urine culture can \\ntake up to seven days to get a result, with the \\nthreshold for diagnosis usually defined as the \\npresence of 10\\n5 colony-forming units (cfu)/ mL of \\na single organism (84). The Gram stain test uses \\ncolour stains (crystal violet and safrinin\\xa0O) to \\nexaggerate and distinguish between Gram-positive \\n(purple) and Gram-negative (red) organisms on a \\nprepared glass slide. Urine dipsticks test for nitrites, \\nwhich are not found in normal urine, and leucocytes, \\nwhich are identified by a reaction with leucocyte \\nesterase, to identify the presence of bacteria and \\npus in the urine, respectively. ASB is associated \\nwith an increased risk of preterm birth; once \\ndetected it is, therefore, usually actively managed \\nwith antibiotics (see also Recommendation C.1, in \\nsection\\xa0C: Preventive measures).\\nnn Intimate partner violence (IPV): IPV, defined as \\nany behaviour within an intimate relationship that \\ncauses physical, psychological or sexual harm to \\nthose in the relationship, is now recognized as a \\nglobal public health issue. Worldwide, almost one \\nthird of all women who have been in a relationship \\nhave experienced physical and/ or sexual violence \\nby their intimate partner (85). Emotional abuse \\n(being humiliated, insulted, intimidated and \\nsubjected to controlling behaviours such as not \\nbeing permitted to see friends or family) also \\nadversely impacts the health of individuals (85).'),\n",

In addition, better on-site tests \\nneed to be developed to improve accuracy and feasibility of testing and to reduce overtreatment of ASB. \\nResearch is also needed to determine the prevalence of ASB at which targeted testing and treatment \\nrather than universal testing and treatment might be effective.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nT est accuracy of on-site urine Gram staining and \\ndipsticks to detect ASB (EB T able\\xa0B.1.2)\\nThe evidence was derived from a test accuracy \\nreview of on-site urine tests conducted to support \\nthe ANC guideline (88). Four studies (1904 pregnant \\nwomen) contributed data on urine Gram staining and \\neight studies (5690 pregnant women) contributed \\ndata on urine dipsticks. Most of the studies were \\nconducted in LMICs. The average prevalence of ASB \\nin the studies was 8%. A Gram stain was positive \\nif one or more bacteria were detected per oil-\\nimmersed field, and a dipstick test was positive if it \\ndetected either nitrites or leucocytes. The reference \\nstandard used was urine culture with a threshold of \\n10\\n5 cfu/ mL.\\nHowever, the certainty of the evidence on the \\naccuracy of both Gram stain tests and dipstick tests \\nis very low, with pooled sensitivity and specificity of \\nthe Gram stain test estimated at 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80–\\n0.91) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.93–0.99), respectively, and \\npooled sensitivity and specificity for urine dipsticks \\nestimated at 0.73 (95% CI: 0.59–0.83) and 0.89 \\n(95% CI: 0.79–0.94), respectively. A positive nitrite \\ntest alone on dipsticks was found to be less sensitive \\nbut more specific than when urine leucocytes were \\nalso considered.\\nAdditional considerations\\nnn A high level of accuracy in detecting ASB is \\nimportant to avoid treating women unnecessarily, \\nparticularly in view of increasing antimicrobial \\nresistance. Based on the uncertain evidence above, \\nand assuming a prevalence of ASB of 9%, there \\nwould be 18 and 118 false-positive tests per 1000 \\nwomen tested with Gram stain and dipstick tests, \\nrespectively. This suggests that, in settings where \\npregnant women are treated for ASB, dipstick \\ndiagnosis of ASB might lead to many women \\nreceiving unnecessary treatment.\\nnn Dipstick tests are multi-test strips that, in addition \\nto testing for nitrites and leucocytes, may also \\ninclude detection of urine protein and glucose. \\nHowever, the accuracy of dipsticks to detect \\nconditions associated with proteinuria (pre-\\neclampsia) and glycosuria (diabetes mellitus) is \\nconsidered to be low.\\nValues\\nPlease see “Women’s values” in section 3.B.1: \\nMaternal assessment: Background (p.\\xa041).\\nResources\\nDipsticks are relatively low cost compared with the \\nGram stain test, as the latter requires trained staff \\nand laboratory equipment and supplies (microscope, \\nglass slides, reagents, Bunsen burner or slide \\nwarmer).

The evidence on clinical enquiry was \\nindirect (strong recommendation) and the evidence on universal screening was judged as being of low to \\nmoderate quality (conditional recommendation).\\n• “Universal screening” or “routine enquiry” (i.e. asking all women at all health-care encounters) about \\nIPV is not recommended. However, the WHO guidelines identify ANC as a setting where routine enquiry \\ncould be implemented if providers are well trained on a first-line response and minimum requirements are \\nmet (86).\\n• Examples of conditions during pregnancy that may be caused or complicated by IPV include (86):\\n – traumatic injury, particularly if repeated and with vague or implausible explanations;\\n – intrusive partner or husband present at consultations;\\n – adverse reproductive outcomes, including multiple unintended pregnancies and/ or terminations, delay \\nin seeking ANC, adverse birth outcomes, repeated STIs;\\n – unexplained or repeated genitourinary symptoms;\\n – symptoms of depression and anxiety;\\n – alcohol and other substance use;\\n – self-harm, suicidality, symptoms of depression and anxiety.\\n• The GDG agreed that, despite a paucity of evidence, it was important to make a recommendation due to \\nthe high prevalence and importance of IPV. ANC provides an opportunity to enquire about IPV among \\nwomen for whom barriers to accessing health care may exist, and also allows for the possibility for \\nfollow-up during ANC with appropriate supportive interventions, such as counselling and empowerment \\ninterventions. However, the evidence on benefits and potential harms of clinical enquiry and subsequent \\ninterventions is lacking or uncertain. \\n• A minimum condition for health-care providers to ask women about violence is that it must be safe to do \\nso (i.e. the partner is not present) and that identification of IPV is followed by an appropriate response. \\nIn addition, providers must be trained to ask questions in the correct way and to respond appropriately to \\nwomen who disclose violence (86).\\n• Research on IPV is needed to answer the following questions:\\n – Which are the most effective strategies for identifying, preventing and managing IPV in pregnancy?\\n – Does asking routinely about violence impact on ANC attendance?\\n – Can interventions targeted at partners of pregnant women prevent IPV?\\n• Detailed guidance on responding to IPV and sexual violence against women can be found in the \\n2013 WHO clinical and policy guidelines (86), available at: http:/ /www.who.int/ reproductivehealth/\\npublications/violence/9789241548595/ en/'),\n",

In the other trial (a cluster-RCT), \\nproviders administered a face-to-face screening \\ntool that screened for 15 risk factors, including IPV, \\nto women between 12 and 30 weeks of gestation in \\nthe intervention clusters, while women in the control \\nclusters received usual ANC.\\nLow-certainty evidence from the review suggests \\nthat abuse assessment screening may identify more \\npregnant women with IPV than those identified \\nthrough usual ANC (2 trials, 663 women; OR: 4.28, \\n95% CI: 1.77–10.36).\\nAdditional considerations\\nnn The review also pooled data on IPV screening \\nversus no IPV screening from other health-care \\nsettings (involving pregnant and non-pregnant \\nwomen), and the pooled effect estimate favoured \\nscreening to detect IPV (7 trials, 4393 women; OR: \\n2.35, 95% CI: 1.53–3.59).\\nnn Another Cochrane review evaluated interventions \\nto prevent or reduce IPV (90). Uncertain evidence \\nfrom one study suggests that pregnant women \\nwho receive IPV interventions (e.g. multiple \\ncounselling sessions) to prevent or reduce IPV \\nmay report fewer episodes of partner violence \\nduring pregnancy and the postpartum period \\n(306 women; RR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.43–0.88), but \\nevidence on this and other outcomes is largely \\ninconclusive.\\nnn Most of the review evidence comes from HICs \\nwhere the prevalence of women experiencing \\nIPV in the previous 12 months ranged from 3% \\nto 6%. However, in many settings, particularly \\nthose where economic and sociocultural factors \\nfoster a culture more permissive of violence \\nagainst women, the lifetime prevalence is higher \\nthan 30%. Notably, the prevalence among young \\nwomen (under 20 years old) approaches 30%, \\nsuggesting that violence commonly starts early in \\nwomen’s relationships (85).\\nnn Severe IPV in pregnancy (such as being beaten up, \\nchoked or burnt on purpose, being threatened with \\nor having a weapon used against her, and sexual \\nviolence) (85) is more common among women \\nwho are in relationships that have also been \\nseverely abusive outside of pregnancy.\\nnn WHO’s clinical handbook on Health care for women \\nsubjected to intimate partner violence or sexual \\nviolence (2014) provides practical guidance on how \\nto respond (91).\\nValues\\nPlease see “Women’s values” in section 3.B.1: \\nMaternal assessment: Background (p.\\xa041).\\nResources\\nClinical enquiry about IPV can be conducted face-\\nto-face or by providing women with a written or \\ncomputer-based questionnaire. Although the costs \\nof implementing these methods can vary, they might \\nbe relatively low. Subsequent management and IPV \\nsupport linked to the screening intervention, however, \\nrequires sophisticated training and can therefore have \\nsignificant cost implications.

T reatment \\nof GDM, which usually involves a stepped approach of lifestyle changes (nutritional counselling and \\nexercise) followed by oral blood-glucose-lowering agents or insulin if necessary, is effective in reducing \\nthese poor outcomes (94).\\n• There are many uncertainties about the cost–effectiveness of different screening strategies, the \\nprevalence of GDM and diabetes mellitus according to the 2013 criteria in diverse populations, and the \\nimpact of earlier diagnosis on pregnancy outcomes (see Chapter 5: Research implications) (94). \\n• The usual window for diagnosing GDM is between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. Risk factor screening \\nis used in some settings as a strategy to determine the need for a 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test \\n(OGTT). These include a BMI of greater than 30 kg/ m\\n2, previous GDM, previous macrosomia, family \\nhistory of diabetes mellitus, and ethnicity with a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus (95). In addition, \\nglycosuria on dipstick testing (2+ or above on one occasion, or 1+ on two or more occasions) may indicate \\nundiagnosed GDM and, if this is observed, performing an OGTT could be considered (95). \\n• The management approach for women classified with diabetes mellitus in pregnancy (i.e. severe \\nhyperglycaemia first detected in pregnancy) usually differs from the approach for women with GDM, \\nparticularly when diagnosed early in pregnancy; however, the principles of management are similar and \\nboth require referral and increased monitoring.\\n• Further information and considerations related to this recommendation can be found in the 2013 WHO \\nguideline (94), available at: http:/ /www.who.int/ diabetes/ publications/Hyperglycaemia_In_Pregnancy/\\nen/\\na This is not a recommendation on routine screening for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy.

This recommendation is based on evidence that shows that providing \\nART to all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV improves individual health outcomes, \\nprevents mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and prevents horizontal transmission of HIV from the \\nmother to an uninfected sexual partner.\\n• Other recommendations relevant to ANC services from the Consolidated guidelines on HIV testing services \\ninclude the following (98):\\n – On disclosure: Initiatives should be put in place to enforce privacy protection and institute policy, \\nlaws and norms that prevent discrimination and promote tolerance and acceptance of people \\nliving with HIV. This can help create environments where disclosure of HIV status is easier (strong \\nrecommendation, low-quality evidence).\\n – On retesting: In settings with a generalized HIV epidemic:b Retest all HIV-negative pregnant women \\nin the third trimester, during labour or postpartum because of the high risk of acquiring HIV infection \\nduring pregnancy (strength of recommendation and quality of evidence not stated). \\n – On retesting: In settings with a concentrated HIV epidemic:c Retest HIV-negative pregnant women \\nwho are in a serodiscordant couple or from a key population groupd (strength of recommendation and \\nquality of evidence not stated). \\n – On retesting before ART initiation: National programmes should retest all people newly and previously \\ndiagnosed with HIV before they enrol in care and initiate ART (strength of recommendation and quality \\nof evidence not stated). \\n – On testing strategies: In settings with greater than 5% HIV prevalence in the population being tested, \\na diagnosis of HIV-positive should be issued to people with two sequential reactive tests.

The GDG considered \\nevidence and other relevant information on the \\nfollowing interventions to assess fetal growth and \\nwell-being in healthy pregnant women not at risk of \\nadverse perinatal outcomes:\\nnn Daily fetal movement counting: Maternal \\nperception of reduced fetal movements is \\nassociated with poor perinatal outcomes, \\nincluding fetal death (106). Daily fetal movement \\ncounting, such as the Cardiff “count-to-ten” \\nmethod using kick charts, is a way of screening \\nfor fetal well-being, by which a woman counts \\ndaily fetal movements to assess the condition \\nof her baby. The aim of this is to try to reduce \\nperinatal mortality by alerting health workers \\nwhen the baby might be compromised (107). \\nDaily fetal movement counting may be used \\nroutinely in all pregnant women or only in women \\nwho are considered to be at increased risk of \\nadverse perinatal outcomes. Early detection of \\nfetal compromise could lead to timely clinical \\ninterventions to reduce poor perinatal outcomes \\nbut might lead to maternal anxiety or unnecessary \\nclinical interventions. It is also possible that the \\nperiod between decreased fetal movements and \\nfetal death might be too short to allow effective \\naction to be taken (108).\\nnn Symphysis-fundal height (SFH) measurement: \\nSFH measurement is a commonly-practiced \\nmethod of fetal growth assessment that uses a \\ntape measure to measure the SFH, in order to \\ndetect intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). \\nIt also has the potential to detect multiple \\npregnancy, macrosomia, polyhydramnios and \\noligohydramnios. For fetuses growing normally, \\nfrom 24 weeks of gestation, the SFH measurement \\nin centimetres should correspond to the number \\nof weeks of gestation, with an allowance of a 2-cm \\ndifference either way (109). Other methods of fetal \\ngrowth assessment include abdominal palpation of \\nfundal height in relation to anatomical landmarks \\nsuch as the umbilicus and xiphisternum, abdominal \\ngirth measurement, and serial ultrasound \\nmeasurement of the fetal parameters (109). \\nAccurate low-cost methods for detecting abnormal \\ngrowth are desirable because ultrasound, the most \\naccurate screening tool, is resource-intensive and \\nnot widely available in LMICs.\\nnn Routine antenatal cardiotocography (CTG):  \\nCTG is a continuous recording of the fetal heart \\nrate and uterine contractions obtained via an \\nultrasound transducer placed on the mother’s \\nabdomen. CTG is widely used in pregnancy \\nas a method of assessing fetal well-being, \\npredominantly in pregnancies with increased risk \\nof complications and during labour.\\nnn Fetal ultrasound examination: Diagnostic \\nultrasound examination is employed in a variety \\nof specific circumstances during pregnancy, such \\nas where there are concerns about fetal growth \\nand after clinical complications. However, because \\nadverse outcomes may also occur in pregnancies \\nwithout clear risk factors, assumptions have been \\nmade that antenatal ultrasound examination in \\nall pregnancies will prove beneficial by enabling \\nearlier detection of problems that may not be \\napparent (110) – such as multiple pregnancies, \\nIUGR, congenital anomalies, malpresentation \\nand placenta praevia – and by allowing accurate \\ngestational age estimation, leading to timely \\nand appropriate management of pregnancy \\ncomplications.\\nnn Fetal Doppler ultrasound examination: Doppler \\nultrasound technology evaluates umbilical artery \\n(and other fetal arteries) waveforms to assess \\nfetal well-being in the third trimester of pregnancy. \\nIt is widely used in high-risk pregnancies to \\nidentify fetal compromise and thus reduce \\nperinatal mortality (111, 112). Therefore, it might \\nalso be useful when performed as an antenatal \\nintervention to detect fetal compromise and \\npredict complications, particularly IUGR and \\npre-eclampsia, in apparently healthy pregnancies. \\nDoppler ultrasound is useful for distinguishing \\nbetween fetuses that are growth-restricted \\n(IUGR) and those that are constitutionally small \\n(SGA) (113). It can be performed as part of a \\nfetal ultrasound examination or separately. The \\nexamination quantifies blood flow through the \\numbilical artery as either a pulsatility index or a \\nresistive index (114). A high resistance to blood \\nflow often indicates an increased risk of IUGR and \\npre-eclampsia and indicates the need for further \\ninvestigation.'),\n",

(Context-specific \\nrecommendation – research)\\nRemarks\\n• Fetal movement counting is when a pregnant woman counts and records her baby’s movements in order \\nto monitor the baby’s health. Various methods have been described, with further monitoring variously \\nindicated depending on the method used, for example, if fewer than six distinct movements are felt within \\n2 hours (115) or fewer than 10\\xa0distinct movements are felt within 12 hours (the Cardiff “count to ten” \\nmethod) (106).\\n• While daily fetal movement counting is not recommended, healthy pregnant women should be made \\naware of the importance of fetal movements in the third trimester and of reporting reduced fetal \\nmovements. \\n• Clinical enquiry by ANC providers at each ANC visit about maternal perception of fetal movements is \\nrecommended as part of good clinical practice. Women who perceive poor or reduced fetal movements \\nrequire further monitoring (e.g. with daily fetal movement counting) and investigation, if indicated. \\n• The GDG agreed that more research is needed on the effects of daily fetal movement counting in the third \\ntrimester of pregnancy, particularly in LMIC settings with a high prevalence of unexplained stillbirths.\\nWomen’s values\\nA scoping review of what women want from ANC and what outcomes they value informed the ANC guideline (13). \\nEvidence showed that women from high-, medium- and low-resource settings valued having a positive pregnancy \\nexperience. Within the context of maternal and fetal assessment, women valued the opportunity to receive screening \\nand tests to optimize their health and that of their baby as long as individual procedures were explained to them \\nclearly and administered by knowledgeable, supportive and respectful health-care practitioners (high confidence in \\nthe evidence).\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of daily maternal fetal movement \\ncounting compared with standard ANC (EB \\nT able B.2.1)\\nThe evidence on the effects of daily fetal movement \\ncounting was derived from a Cochrane review \\n(107). T wo RCT s from HICs contributed data for this \\ncomparison. One was a large, multicentre, cluster \\nRCT (68\\xa0654 women) conducted in Belgium, Ireland, \\nSweden, the United Kingdom and the USA, which \\ncompared a “count-to-ten” fetal movement counting \\nkick chart with standard ANC in women with \\nuncomplicated pregnancies recruited between 28 \\nand 32 weeks of gestation. Women in the standard \\nANC group were asked about fetal movements at \\neach ANC visit. The other trial was a multicentre \\nRCT conducted in Norway involving 1123 women that \\ncompared a modified “count-to-ten” fetal movement \\ncounting protocol with standard care.\\nMaternal outcomes\\nLow-certainty evidence suggests that daily fetal \\nmovement counting may make little or no difference \\nto caesarean section (1 trial, 1076 women; RR: 0.93, \\n95% CI: 0.60–1.44) or assisted vaginal delivery rates \\n(1 trial, 1076 women; RR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.65–1.66).\\nWith regard to maternal satisfaction, low-certainty \\nevidence suggests that daily fetal movement counting \\nmay reduce mean anxiety scores (1 trial, 1013 women; \\nstandardized MD: –0.22, 95% CI: –0.35 to –0.10).\\nFetal and neonatal outcomes\\nLow-certainty evidence suggests that there may be \\nlittle or no difference to preterm birth (1 trial, 1076'),\n",

However, stakeholders should consider offering a late ultrasound scan to pregnant \\nwomen who have not had an early ultrasound scan, for the purposes of identifying the number of fetuses, \\npresentation and placental location. \\n• The GDG noted that the effects of introducing antenatal ultrasound on population health outcomes and \\nhealth systems in rural, low-resource settings are unproven. However, the introduction of ultrasound to \\ndetect pregnancy complications and confirm fetal viability to the woman and her family in these settings \\ncould plausibly increase ANC service utilization and reduce morbidity and mortality, when accompanied \\nby appropriate gestational age estimation, diagnosis, referral and management. \\n• The ongoing multicountry trial that is under way should contribute further evidence on health effects, \\nhealth care utilization and implementation-related information on ultrasound in rural, low-resource \\nsettings (118). \\n• The GDG acknowledged that the use of early pregnancy ultrasound has not been shown to reduce \\nperinatal mortality. The GDG put emphasis on other benefits of ultrasound (mentioned in points above) \\nand the increased accuracy of gestational age assessment, which would assist management in case of \\nsuspected preterm birth and reduce labour induction for post-term pregnancies.\\n• The GDG acknowledges that implementing and scaling up this recommendation in low-resource settings \\nwill be associated with a variety of challenges that may include political (budgeting for fees and tariffs), \\nlogistical (equipment maintenance, supplies, technical support), infrastructural (ensuring a reliable power \\nsupply and secure storage) and resources.\\n• The GDG noted that antenatal ultrasound is an intervention that can potentially be task shifted from \\ntrained sonographers and doctors to trained nurses, midwives and clinical officers, provided that ongoing \\ntraining, staff retention, quality improvement activities and supervision are ensured.\\n• Stakeholders might be able to offset/ reduce the cost of antenatal ultrasound if the ultrasound equipment \\nis also used for other indications (e.g. obstetric emergencies) or by other medical departments.\\n• The implementation and impact of this recommendation on health outcomes, facility utilization and \\nequity should be monitored at the health service, regional and country levels, based on clearly defined \\ncriteria and indicators associated with locally agreed targets.\\na \\n• For further guidance, please refer to the WHO Manual of diagnostic ultrasound (119), available at:  \\nhttp:/ /www.who.int/ medical_devices/ publications/ manual_ultrasound_pack1-2/ en/\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\na) Effects of an ultrasound scan before 24 weeks \\nof gestation (early ultrasound scan) versus \\nselective ultrasound scan (EB T able B.2.4a)\\nThe evidence on early ultrasound was derived from \\na Cochrane review that included 11 RCT s conducted \\nin Australia, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, the \\nUnited Kingdom and the USA, involving 37\\xa0505 \\nwomen (120).

Evidence and recommendations \\n63\\nC. Preventive measures\\nBackground\\nThe GDG considered the evidence and other relevant \\ninformation to inform recommendations on antenatal \\ninterventions to prevent the following conditions.\\nnn Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB): Defined as true \\nbacteriuria in the absence of specific symptoms \\nof acute urinary tract infection, ASB is common \\nin pregnancy, with rates as high as 74% reported \\nin some LMICs (125). Escherichia coli is associated \\nwith up to 80% of isolates (83). Other pathogens \\ninclude Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis and \\ngroup B streptococcus (GBS). While ASB in non-\\npregnant women is generally benign, in pregnant \\nwomen obstruction to the flow of urine by the \\ngrowing fetus and womb leads to stasis in the \\nurinary tract and increases the likelihood of acute \\npyelonephritis. If untreated, up to 45% of pregnant \\nwomen with ASB may develop this complication \\n(126), which is associated with an increased risk of \\npreterm birth.\\nnn Recurrent urinary tract infections: A recurrent \\nurinary tract infection (RUTI) is a symptomatic \\ninfection of the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) \\nthat follows the resolution of a previous urinary \\ntract infection (UTI), generally after treatment. \\nDefinitions of RUTI vary and include two UTIs \\nwithin the previous six months, or a history of one \\nor more UTIs before or during pregnancy (127). \\nRUTIs are common in women who are pregnant \\nand have been associated with adverse pregnancy \\noutcomes including preterm birth and small-for-\\ngestational-age newborns (127). Pyelonephritis \\n(infection of the kidneys) is estimated to occur in \\n2% of pregnancies, with a recurrence rate of up to \\n23% within the same pregnancy or soon after the \\nbirth (128). Little is known about the best way to \\nprevent RUTI in pregnancy.\\nnn Rhesus D alloimmunization: Rhesus (Rh) negative \\nmothers can develop Rh antibodies if they have an \\nRh-positive newborn, causing haemolytic disease \\nof the newborn (HDN) in subsequent pregnancies. \\nAdministering anti-D immunoglobulin to Rh-\\nnegative women within 72\\xa0hours of giving birth \\nto an Rh-positive baby is an effective way of \\npreventing RhD alloimmunization and HDN (129). \\nHowever, Rhesus alloimmunization occurring in \\nthe third trimester due to occult transplacental \\nhaemorrhages will not be prevented by postpartum \\nanti-D.\\nnn Soil-transmitted helminthiasis: Over 50% of \\npregnant women in LMICs suffer from anaemia, \\nand helminthiasis is a major contributory cause \\nin endemic areas (33). Soil-transmitted helminths \\nare parasitic infections caused mainly by \\nroundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides), hookworms \\n(Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale), \\nand whipworms (Trichuris trichiura). These worms \\n(particularly hookworms) feed on blood and \\ncause further bleeding by releasing anticoagulant \\ncompounds, thereby causing iron-deficiency \\nanaemia (130). They may also reduce the \\nabsorption of iron and other nutrients by causing \\nanorexia, vomiting and diarrhoea (131).\\nnn Neonatal tetanus: T etanus is an acute disease \\ncaused by an exotoxin produced by Clostridium \\ntetani. Neonatal infection usually occurs through \\nthe exposure of the unhealed umbilical cord stump \\nto tetanus spores, which are universally present in \\nsoil, and newborns need to have received maternal \\nantibodies via the placenta to be protected at birth. \\nNeonatal disease usually presents within the first \\ntwo weeks of life and involves generalized rigidity \\nand painful muscle spasms, which in the absence \\nof medical treatment leads to death in most \\ncases (132). Global vaccination programmes have \\nreduced the global burden of neonatal tetanus \\ndeaths and continue to do so; estimates show a \\nreduction from an estimated 146\\xa0000 in 2000 \\nto 58\\xa0000 (CI: 20\\xa0000–276\\xa0000) in 2010 (133). \\nHowever, because tetanus spores are ubiquitous \\nin the environment, eradication is not biologically \\nfeasible and high immunization coverage remains \\nessential (134).\\nIn addition to GDG recommendations on the \\nabove, this section of the guideline includes \\ntwo recommendations on disease prevention in \\npregnancy that have been integrated from WHO \\nguidelines on malaria and HIV prevention that are \\nrelevant to routine ANC.'),\n",

(Recommended)\\nRemarks\\n• This recommendation is consistent with recommendations from the 2006 WHO guideline on Maternal \\nimmunization against tetanus (134). The GDG endorses the 2006 guideline approach, which recommends \\nthe following.\\n – If a pregnant woman has not previously been vaccinated, or if her immunization status is unknown, \\nshe should receive two doses of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine (TT-CV) one month apart with \\nthe second dose given at least two weeks before delivery. T wo doses protect against tetanus infection \\nfor 1–3 years in most people. A third dose is recommended six months after the second dose, which \\nshould extend protection to at least five years.\\n – T wo further doses for women who are first vaccinated against tetanus during pregnancy should be \\ngiven after the third dose, in the two subsequent years or during two subsequent pregnancies.\\n – If a woman has had 1–4 doses of a TT-CV in the past, she should receive one dose of a TT-CV during \\neach subsequent pregnancy to a total of five doses (five doses protects throughout the childbearing \\nyears).\\n• T etanus vaccination and clean delivery practices are major components of the strategy to eradicate \\nmaternal and neonatal tetanus globally (147).\\n• Effective surveillance is critical for identifying areas or populations at high risk of neonatal tetanus and for \\nmonitoring the impact of interventions.\\n• A monitoring system should include an immunization register, personal vaccination cards and maternal \\nhealth records, which should be held by the woman.\\n• For effective implementation, ANC health-care providers need to be trained in tetanus vaccination and \\nthe vaccine, equipment and supplies (refrigerator, needles and syringes) need to be readily available at \\nANC services.\\n• Policy-makers in low prevalence/high-income settings may choose not to include tetanus vaccination \\namong ANC interventions if effective tetanus immunization programmes and good post-exposure \\nprophylaxis exist outside of pregnancy.\\n• ANC contacts should be used to verify the vaccination status of pregnant women, and administer \\nany vaccines that are recommended in the national immunization schedule. ANC contacts are also \\nopportunities to explain the importance of infant vaccination and communicate the infant/ child \\nvaccination schedule to pregnant women.\\n• Further information can be found in the WHO guidance (134), available at: http:/ /www.who.int/\\nreproductivehealth/ publications/ maternal_perinatal_health/immunization_tetanus.pdf; and in WHO’s \\nvaccine position papers, available at: http:/ /www.who.int/immunization/ documents/ positionpapers/ en\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of antenatal tetanus toxoid (TT) \\nvaccination compared with no, other or placebo \\nvaccination (EB T able C.5)\\nThe evidence on the effects of TT vaccination was \\nderived from a Cochrane review that assessed \\nthe effect of tetanus vaccination in women of \\nreproductive age or pregnant women to prevent \\nneonatal tetanus (148).

Pharmacological \\nagents included antihistamines, phenothiazines, \\ndopamine-receptor antagonists and serotonin 5-HT3 \\nreceptor antagonists. Due to heterogeneity among \\nthe types of interventions and reporting of outcomes, \\nreviewers were seldom able to pool data. The primary \\noutcome of all interventions was maternal relief \\nfrom symptoms (usually measured using the Rhodes \\nIndex), and perinatal outcomes relevant to this \\nguideline were rarely reported.\\nNon-pharmacological agents versus placebo or no \\ntreatment\\nT en trials evaluated non-pharmacological \\ninterventions including ginger (prepared as syrup, \\ncapsules or powder within biscuits) (7 trials from \\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Thailand \\nand the USA involving 578 participants), lemon oil \\n(one Iranian study, 100 participants), mint oil (one \\nIranian study, 60 participants), chamomile (one \\nIranian study, 105 participants), and vitamin B6 \\ninterventions (two studies in Thailand and the USA; \\n416 participants) compared with no treatment or \\nplacebo.\\nGinger: Low-certainty evidence from several small \\nindividual studies suggests that ginger may relieve \\nsymptoms of nausea and vomiting.

Evidence and recommendations \\n85\\nE. Health systems interventions to \\nimprove the utilization and quality  \\nof ANC\\nBackground\\nThere is a multitude of interventions that can be \\nemployed to improve the utilization and quality of \\nANC depending on the context and setting. For the \\npurposes of this guideline, the GDG considered the \\nfollowing interventions:\\n1. Women-held case notes (home-based records)\\n2. Midwife-led continuity of care models\\n3. Group ANC\\n4. Community-based interventions to improve \\ncommunication and support\\n5. T ask shifting\\n6. Recruitment and retention of staff\\n7. ANC contact schedules.\\nHow to deliver the type and quality of ANC that \\nwomen want is a vast and complex field of research. \\nInterventions designed to increase staff competency, \\nto improve staff well-being, and other interventions \\n(e.g. financial incentives) to increase access and use \\nof ANC are broad topics that were considered beyond \\nthe scope of this guideline.\\nnn Women-held case notes: In many countries, \\nwomen are given their own case notes (or home-\\nbased records) to carry during pregnancy. Case \\nnotes may be held in paper (e.g. card, journal, \\nhandbook) or electronic formats (e.g. memory \\nstick), and women are expected to take them \\nalong to all health visits. If women then move, or \\nare referred from one facility to another, and in the \\ncase of complications where immediate access \\nto medical records is not always possible, the \\npractice of women-held case notes may improve \\nthe availability of women’s medical records \\n(168). Women-held case notes might also be an \\neffective tool to improve health awareness and \\nclient–provider communication (169). Inadequate \\ninfrastructure and resources often hamper efficient \\nrecord-keeping, therefore, case notes may be \\nless likely to get lost when held personally. In \\naddition, the practice may facilitate more accurate \\nestimation of gestational age, which is integral to \\nevidence-based decision-making, due to improved \\ncontinuity of fetal growth records (170).\\nnn Midwife-led continuity of care (MLCC) models: \\nMidwives are the primary providers of care in \\nmany ANC settings (171). In MLCC models, a \\nknown and trusted midwife (caseload midwifery), \\nor small group of known midwives (team \\nmidwifery), supports a woman throughout the \\nantenatal, intrapartum and postnatal period, to \\nfacilitate a healthy pregnancy and childbirth, and \\nhealthy parenting practices (172). The MLCC \\nmodel includes: continuity of care; monitoring \\nthe physical, psychological, spiritual and social \\nwell-being of the woman and family throughout \\nthe childbearing cycle; providing the woman with \\nindividualized education, counselling and ANC; \\nattendance during labour, birth and the immediate \\npostpartum period by a known midwife; ongoing \\nsupport during the postnatal period; minimizing \\nunnecessary technological interventions; and \\nidentifying, referring and coordinating care for \\nwomen who require obstetric or other specialist \\nattention (173). Thus, the MLCC model exists \\nwithin a multidisciplinary network in which \\nconsultation and referral to other care providers \\noccurs when necessary. The MLCC model is \\nusually aimed at providing care to healthy women \\nwith uncomplicated pregnancies.\\nnn Group ANC: ANC conventionally takes the form \\nof a one-on-one consultation between a pregnant \\nwoman and her health-care provider. However, \\ngroup ANC integrates the usual individual \\npregnancy health assessment with tailored group \\neducational activities and peer support, with \\nthe aim of motivating behaviour change among \\npregnant women, improving pregnancy outcomes, \\nand increasing women’s satisfaction (174). The \\nintervention typically involves self-assessment \\nactivities (e.g. blood pressure measurement), \\ngroup education with facilitated discussion, and'),\n",

Group ANC needs to be delivered \\nin a space large enough to accommodate a group \\nof women, with a private area for examinations.\\nnn Community-based interventions to improve \\ncommunication and support: The scoping review \\nconducted for the ANC guideline identified \\ncommunication and support for women as \\nintegral components of positive pregnancy \\nexperiences. The term “communicate” refers to \\nthe act of sharing information, education and \\ncommunication with women about timely and \\nrelevant physiological, biomedical, behavioural \\nand sociocultural issues; “support” refers to social, \\ncultural, emotional and psychological support (13). \\nHaving access to appropriate communication and \\nsupport is a key element of a quality ANC service. \\nA human-rights-based approach recognizes that \\nwomen are entitled to participate in decisions that \\naffect their sexual and reproductive health (1). In \\naddition, pregnant women have a right to access \\nquality health-care services and, particularly in \\nlow-resource settings, may need to be empowered \\nto do so. Interventions that increase the dialogue \\naround awareness of a women’s rights, barriers \\nand facilitators to utilizing ANC rvices and keeping \\nhealthy during pregnancy and beyond (including \\ndialogue around newborn care and postnatal \\nfamily planning), and providing women and their \\npartners with support in addressing challenges \\nthey may face, may lead to improved ANC uptake \\nand quality of care.\\nnn ANC contact schedules: In 2002, the WHO \\nrecommended a focused or goal-orientated \\napproach to ANC to improve quality of care and \\nincrease ANC coverage, particularly in LMICs (12). \\nThe focused ANC (FANC) model, also known as \\nthe basic ANC model, includes four ANC visits \\noccurring between 8 and 12\\xa0weeks of gestation, \\nbetween 24 and 26\\xa0weeks, at 32\\xa0weeks, and \\nbetween 36 and 38\\xa0weeks. Guidance on each visit \\nincludes specific evidence-based interventions for \\nhealthy pregnant women (called “goal-oriented”), \\nwith appropriate referral of high-risk women and \\nthose who develop pregnancy complications. The \\nnumber of visits in this model is considerably fewer \\nthan in ANC models used in HICs.\\nThe GDG considered the available evidence and \\nother relevant information on these interventions to \\ndetermine whether they should be recommended for \\nANC (Recommendations E1 to E5). The GDG also \\nconsidered existing recommendations from other \\nWHO guidelines on task shifting and recruitment and \\nretention of staff in rural areas (Recommendations E5 \\nand E6).\\nWomen’s values\\nA scoping review of what women want from ANC \\nand what outcomes they value informed the ANC \\nguideline (13). Evidence showed that women from \\nhigh-, medium- and low-resource settings valued \\nhaving a positive pregnancy experience. Within a \\nhealth systems context, this included the adoption \\nof flexible appointment systems and continuity of \\nprovider care where women were given privacy and \\ntime to build authentic and supportive relationships \\nwith maternity-care providers (high confidence in \\nthe evidence).'),\n",

Health systems that give women access to their case notes through electronic systems \\nneed to ensure that all pregnant women have access to the appropriate technology and that attention is \\npaid to data security.\\n• Health-system planners should ensure that the contents of the case notes are accessible to all pregnant \\nwomen through the use of appropriate, local languages and appropriate reading levels.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of women-held case notes compared \\nwith other practices (EB T able E.1)\\nThe evidence on the effects of women-held case \\nnotes was mostly derived from a Cochrane review that \\nincluded four small trials involving 1176 women (168). \\nT rials were conducted in Australia, Mongolia and the \\nUnited Kingdom (2 trials). In three trials, women in \\nthe intervention groups were given their complete \\nantenatal records (paper) to carry during pregnancy. \\nIn the remaining trial, a cluster randomized controlled \\ntrial (RCT) involving 501 women in Mongolia, women \\nin the intervention group carried a maternal and child \\nhealth handbook that included antenatal, postnatal and \\nchild health records.

Evidence and recommendations \\n89\\nE.2: Midwife-led continuity of care (MLCC)\\nRECOMMENDATION E.2: Midwife-led continuity-of-care models, in which a known midwife or \\nsmall group of known midwives supports a woman throughout the antenatal, intrapartum and \\npostnatal continuum, are recommended for pregnant women in settings with well functioning \\nmidwifery programmes. (Context-specific recommendation)\\nRemarks\\n• MLCC models are models of care in which a known and trusted midwife (caseload midwifery), or small \\ngroup of known midwives (team midwifery), supports a woman throughout the antenatal, intrapartum \\nand postnatal period, to facilitate a healthy pregnancy and childbirth, and healthy parenting practices.\\n• MLCC models are complex interventions and it is unclear whether the pathway of influence producing \\nthese positive effects is the continuity of care, the midwifery philosophy of care or both. The midwifery \\nphilosophy inherent in MLCC models may or may not be enacted in standard midwife practice in other \\nmodels of care.\\n• Policy-makers in settings without well functioning midwife programmes should consider implementing \\nthis model only after successfully scaling up of the number and quality of practising midwives. In addition, \\nstakeholders may wish to consider ways of providing continuous care through other care providers, because \\nwomen value continuity of care.\\n• The panel noted that with this model of care it is important to monitor resource use, and provider burnout \\nand workload, to determine whether caseload or team care models are more sustainable in individual \\nsettings.\\n• MLCC requires that well trained midwives are available in sufficient numbers for each woman to see one \\nor only a small group of midwives throughout pregnancy and during childbirth. This model may therefore \\nrequire a shift in resources to ensure that the health system has access to a sufficient number of midwives \\nwith reasonable caseloads.\\n• The introduction of MLCC may lead to a shift in the roles and responsibilities of midwives as well as other \\nhealth-care professionals who have previously been responsible for antenatal and postnatal care. Where \\nthis is the case, implementation is likely to be more effective if all relevant stakeholders are consulted \\nand human resources departments are involved. In some settings, government-level consultation with \\nprofessional organizations could also aid implementation processes.\\n• The need for additional one-off or continuing training and education should be assessed, and should be \\nprovided where necessary.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of MLCC models compared with other \\nmodels of care (EB T able E.2)\\nThe evidence on the effects of MLCC models of care \\nwas derived from a Cochrane review that included \\n15 trials involving 17\\xa0674 women, in which pregnant \\nwomen were randomized to receive ANC either by \\nMLCC models or by other models of care (172). All \\nthe studies included were conducted in public health \\nsystems in HICs (Australia, Canada, Ireland and \\nthe United Kingdom) and 14 out of 15 contributed \\ndata. Eight trials compared an MLCC model with \\na shared care model, three trials compared MLCC \\nwith medical-led care, and three compared MLCC \\nwith “standard care” (mixed-care options, including \\nmidwife-led non-continuous care, medical-led, and \\nshared care). Some MLCC models included routine \\nvisits to an obstetrician and/ or family doctor. Eight \\ntrials included women with “low-risk” pregnancies \\nonly; six also included women with “high-risk” \\npregnancies. Four trials evaluated one-to-one \\n(caseload) MLCC and 10 trials evaluated team MLCC. \\nCaseload sizes for one-to-one models ranged from 32 \\nto 45 pregnant women per midwife per year. Levels of \\ncontinuity of care were measured (as the proportion \\nof births attended to by a known carer), and were \\nin the ranges of 63–98% for MLCC and 0–21% for \\nother models. A random effects model was used in all \\nmeta-analyses.\\nMaternal outcomes\\nModerate-certainty evidence shows that MLCC \\ncompared with other models of care probably slightly \\nincreases the chance of a vaginal birth (12 trials, \\n16\\xa0687 participants; RR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.03–1.07).'),\n",

(Context-specific recommendation \\n– research)\\nRemarks\\n• With the group ANC model, the first visit for all pregnant women is an individual visit. Then at subsequent \\nvisits, the usual individual pregnancy health assessment, held in a private examination area, is integrated \\ninto a group ANC session, with facilitated educational activities and peer support.\\n• Health-care facilities need to be seeing sufficient numbers of pregnant women, as allocation to groups is \\nideally performed according to gestational age.\\n• Health-care providers need to have appropriate facilities to deal with group sessions, including access \\nto large, well ventilated rooms or sheltered spaces with adequate seating. A private space should be \\navailable for examinations, and opportunities should be given for private conversations.\\n• Group ANC may take longer than individual ANC, and this may pose practical problems for some women \\nin terms of work and childcare. Health-care providers should be able to offer a variety of time slots for \\ngroup sessions (morning, afternoon, evening) and should consider making individual care available as \\nwell.\\n• The GDG noted that group ANC may have acceptability and feasibility issues in settings where perceived \\ndifferences keep people apart, e.g. women from different castes in India may not wish to be in a group \\ntogether.\\n• Group ANC studies are under way in Nepal, Uganda and five other low-income countries, and the GDG \\nwas informed by a GDG member that some of these studies are due to report soon. Core outcomes of \\nstudies of group ANC should include maternal and perinatal health outcomes, coverage, and women's \\nand providers' experiences.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of group ANC compared with individual \\nANC (EB T able E.3)\\nThe evidence on the effects of group ANC was \\nderived from a Cochrane review that included \\nfour trials involving 2350 women (174). T wo trials \\nfrom the USA used a group ANC model known as \\nCenteringPregnancy®, in which group ANC was \\nconducted in circles of 8–12 women of similar \\ngestational age, meeting for 8–10 sessions during \\npregnancy, with each session lasting 90–120 minutes. \\nssions included self-assessment activities (blood \\npressure measurement), facilitated educational \\ndiscussions and time to socialize, with individual \\nexaminations performed in a private/ screened-\\noff area. One trial conducted in Sweden used a \\ngroup model similar to the USA model but mainly \\nassessed provider outcomes and contributed little \\ndata to the review. The fourth trial, conducted in the \\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was a cluster-RCT in which \\ngroup ANC was described as being similar to the \\nCenteringPregnancy® approach.\\nMaternal outcomes\\nModerate-certainty evidence indicates that group \\nANC probably does not have an important effect on \\nvaginal birth rates compared with individual ANC \\n(1 trial, 322 women; RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.80–1.15). \\nBut low-certainty evidence suggests that it may lead \\nto higher women’s satisfaction scores (1 trial, 993 \\nwomen; MD: 4.9, 95% CI: 3.10–6.70).\\nFetal and neonatal outcomes\\nModerate-certainty evidence indicates that group \\nANC probably has little or no effect on low birth \\nweight (3 trials, 1935 neonates; RR: 0.92, 95% CI: \\n0.68–1.23) and low-certainty evidence suggests that \\nit may have little or no effect on perinatal mortality \\n(3\\xa0trials, 1943 neonates; RR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.32–1.25). \\nHowever, low-certainty evidence also suggests that \\ngroup ANC may reduce preterm birth (3 trials, 1888 \\nwomen; RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57–1.00); this evidence \\nincludes the possibility of no effect.

However, training and \\nsupervising health-care providers to conduct group-\\nbased counselling and participatory discussions is \\nalso associated with cost. Group ANC visits take \\nlonger than individual visits, therefore, from a user \\nperspective, there may be additional costs associated \\nwith the time each pregnant woman needs to take \\noff work. However, in many settings, long waiting \\ntimes are the norm, so group ANC with a scheduled \\nappointment could represent a reduced visit time.\\nEquity\\nLess-educated women are more likely to have poor \\nmaternal health literacy than more-educated women \\n(179). Therefore, interventions such as group ANC that \\naim to improve women’s ability to access, understand \\nand use educational materials could have a positive \\nimpact on reducing health inequalities by improving \\nmaternal health literacy among disadvantaged \\nwomen. In addition, social support is often lacking for \\ndisadvantaged women and group ANC may help to \\nreduce inequalities by facilitating the development of \\npeer support networks. However, in certain settings, \\nwhere group ANC sessions take longer than standard \\nANC visits, there may be greater cost implications \\nfor disadvantaged women. In addition, in settings \\nwith poor transport systems or variable weather, the \\nappointment system with group ANC may not be \\nsuitable and may have a negative impact on equity \\nfor women living in remote areas. Furthermore, some \\ndisadvantaged women might find it harder to disclose \\npersonal information in a group setting and might \\nprefer a more private approach to ANC.\\nAcceptability\\nQualitative evidence from several HICs suggests \\nthat women enjoy the group format and use the \\nopportunity to build socially supportive relationships \\nwith other pregnant women and health-care \\nprofessionals (high confidence in the evidence) \\n(22). The flexibility of the format allows women to \\nexchange valuable information with each other and \\ndiscuss pregnancy-related concerns in a relaxed \\nand informal manner (high confidence in the \\nevidence). Most women appreciate the additional \\ntime inherent in the group approach (high confidence \\nin the evidence), although some women do not \\nattend group sessions because of the additional \\ntime commitments (moderate confidence in the \\nevidence). Some women have reservations about the \\nlack of privacy during the group sessions, particularly \\nduring physical examinations (low confidence in \\nthe evidence) and the desire to have partners/\\nhusbands included varies (moderate confidence \\nin the evidence).

With the FANC model, the first \\nANC visit occurs before 12\\xa0weeks of pregnancy, the second around 26\\xa0weeks, the third around 32\\xa0weeks, \\nand the fourth between 36 and 38\\xa0weeks of gestation. Thereafter, women are advised to return to ANC \\nat 41\\xa0weeks of gestation or sooner if they experience danger signs. Each ANC visit involves specific goals \\naimed at improving triage and timely referral of high-risk women and includes educational components \\n(12). However, up-to-date evidence shows that the FANC model, which was developed in the 1990s, is \\nprobably associated with more perinatal deaths than models that comprise at least eight ANC visits. \\nFurthermore, evidence suggests that more ANC visits, irrespective of the resource setting, is probably \\nassociated with greater maternal satisfaction than less ANC visits.\\n• The GDG prefers the word “contact” to “visit”, as it implies an active connection between a \\npregnant woman and a health-care provider that is not implicit with the word “visit”. In terms of \\nthe operationalization of this recommendation, “contact” can be adapted to local contexts through \\ncommunity outreach programmes and lay health worker involvement.\\n• The decision regarding the number of contacts with a health system was also influenced by the following:\\n – evidence supporting improving safety during pregnancy through increased frequency of maternal and \\nfetal assessment to detect problems;\\n – evidence supporting improving health system communication and support around pregnancy for \\nwomen and families;\\n – evidence from HIC studies indicating no important differences in maternal and perinatal health \\noutcomes between ANC models that included at least eight contacts and ANC models that included \\nmore (11–15) contacts (203);\\n – evidence indicating that more contact between pregnant women and knowledgeable, supportive and \\nrespectful health-care practitioners is more likely to lead to a positive pregnancy experience.\\n• Implementation considerations related to this recommendation and the mapping of guideline \\nrecommendations to ANC contacts are presented in Chapter 4: Implementation of the ANC guideline and \\nrecommendations.\\nSummary of evidence and considerations\\nEffects of the FANC model (with four visits) \\ncompared with “standard” ANC (with at least \\neight ANC visits planned) (EB T able E.7)\\nThe evidence on the effects of FANC (the four-visit \\nANC model) was derived from a Cochrane review \\non “reduced-visit” ANC models versus “standard” \\ncare models (with at least eight ANC visits planned) \\nthat included seven RCT s (203). Four individual RCT s \\nwere conducted in HICs (the United Kingdom and the \\nUSA) and three large cluster-RCT s were conducted in \\nLMICs, including one conducted in Argentina, Cuba, \\nSaudi Arabia and Thailand (204), and two conducted \\nin Zimbabwe. The LMIC trials evaluated the FANC \\nmodel compared with “standard” ANC models that \\nplanned for at least eight visits (12). Three cluster-\\nRCT s involving more than 50\\xa0000 women contributed \\ndata.

In general, \\nhowever, evidence from these individual studies \\nalso suggests that the reduced-visit models may be \\nassociated with lower women’s satisfaction.\\nnn The GDG considered unpublished evidence from \\nfour country case studies (Argentina, Kenya, \\nThailand and the United Republic of T anzania) \\nwhere the FANC model has been implemented \\n(207). Provider compliance was noted to be \\nproblematic in some settings, as were shortages \\nof equipment, supplies and staff. Integration of \\nservices was found to be particularly challenging, \\nespecially in settings with a high prevalence of \\nendemic infections (e.g. malaria, TB, sexually \\ntransmitted infections, helminthiasis). Guidance \\non implementation of the FANC model in such \\nsettings was found to be inadequate, as was the \\namount of time allowed within the four-visit model \\nto provide integrated care.\\nnn Findings on provider compliance from these case \\nstudies are consistent with published findings from \\nrural Burkina Faso, Uganda and the United Republic \\nof T anzania (208). Health-care providers in this \\nstudy were found to variably omit certain practices \\nfrom the FANC model, including blood pressure \\nmeasurement and provision of information on \\ndanger signs, and to spend less than 15\\xa0minutes \\nper ANC visit. Such reports suggest that fitting all \\nthe components of the FANC model into four visits \\nis difficult to achieve in some low-resource settings \\nwhere services are already overstretched. In \\naddition, in low-resource settings, when the target \\nis set at four ANC visits, due to the various barriers \\nto ANC use, far fewer than four visits may actually \\nbe achieved.\\nnn Programmatic evidence from Ghana and Kenya \\nindicates similar levels of satisfaction between \\nFANC and standard ANC, with sources of \\ndissatisfaction with both models being long \\nwaiting times and costs associated with care (209, \\n210).\\nnn Emotional and psychosocial needs are variable \\nand the needs of vulnerable groups (including \\nadolescent girls, displaced and war-affected \\nwomen, women with disabilities, women with \\nmental health concerns, women living with HIV, \\nsex workers, ethnic and racial minorities, among \\nothers) can be greater than for other women. \\nTherefore, the number and content of visits should \\nbe adaptable to local context and to the individual \\nwoman.\\nValues\\nSee “Women’s values” at the beginning of section \\n3.E:\\xa0Background (p.\\xa086).\\nResources\\nT wo trials evaluated cost implications of two \\nmodels of ANC with reduced visits, one in the \\nUnited Kingdom and one in two LMICs (Cuba and \\nThailand). Costs per pregnancy to both women and \\nproviders were lower with the reduced visits models \\nin both settings. Time spent accessing care was also \\nsignificantly shorter with reduced visits models. In the \\nUnited Kingdom trial, there was an increase in costs \\nrelated to neonatal intensive care unit stays in the \\nreduced visit model.\\nEquity\\nPreventable maternal and perinatal mortality is \\nhighest among disadvantaged populations, which \\nare at greater risk of various health problems, such \\nas nutritional deficiencies and infections, that \\npredispose women to poor pregnancy outcomes. \\nThis suggests that, in LMICs, more and better quality \\ncontact between pregnant women with health-care \\nproviders would help to address health inequalities.\\nAcceptability\\nEvidence from high-, medium- and low-resource \\nsettings suggests that women do not like reduced \\nvisit schedules and would prefer more contact with \\nantenatal services (moderate confidence in the \\nevidence) (22). Women value the opportunity to build \\nsupportive relationships during their pregnancy (high \\nconfidence in the evidence) and for some women, \\nespecially in LMIC settings, the reduced visit schedule \\nmay limit their ability to develop these relationships, \\nboth with health-care professionals and with other \\npregnant women (low confidence in the evidence). \\nIn some low-income settings where women rely on \\nhusbands or partners to financially support their \\nantenatal visits, the reduced visit schedule limits \\ntheir ability to procure additional finance (low \\nconfidence in the evidence).

Implementation of the ANC \\nguideline and recommendations: \\nintroducing the 2016 WHO ANC model\\nThe ultimate goal of this guideline and its \\nrecommendations is to improve the quality \\nof ANC and to improve maternal, fetal and \\nnewborn outcomes related to ANC. These ANC \\nrecommendations need to be deliverable within an \\nappropriate model of care that can be adapted to \\ndifferent countries, local contexts and the individual \\nwoman. With the contributions of the members of \\nthe Guideline Development Group (GDG), WHO \\nreviewed existing models of delivering ANC with \\nfull consideration of the range of interventions \\nrecommended within this guideline (Chapter 3). \\nRecommendation\\xa0E.7 states that “Antenatal care \\nmodels with a minimum of eight contacts are \\nrecommended to reduce perinatal mortality and \\nimprove women’s experience of care”; taking this as \\na foundation, the GDG reviewed how ANC should \\nbe delivered in terms of both the timing and content \\nof each of the ANC contacts, and arrived at a new \\nmodel – the 2016 WHO ANC model – which replaces \\nthe previous four-visit focused ANC (FANC) model. \\nFor the purpose of developing this new ANC model, \\nthe ANC guideline recommendations were mapped to \\nthe eight contacts based on the evidence supporting \\neach recommendation and the optimal timing of \\ndelivery of the recommended interventions to achieve \\nmaximal impact.\\nThe 2016 WHO ANC model recommends a minimum \\nof eight ANC contacts, with the first contact \\nscheduled to take place in the first trimester (up to \\n12 weeks of gestation), two contacts scheduled in the \\nsecond trimester (at 20 and 26 weeks of gestation) \\nand five contacts scheduled in the third trimester (at \\n30, 34, 36, 38 and 40 weeks). Within this model, the \\nword “contact” has been used instead of “visit”, as \\nit implies an active connection between a pregnant \\nwoman and a health-care provider that is not implicit \\nwith the word “visit”. It should be noted that the list \\nof interventions to be delivered at each contact and \\ndetails about where they are delivered and by whom \\n(see T able 2) are not meant to be prescriptive but, \\nrather, adaptable to the individual woman and the \\nlocal context, to allow flexibility in the delivery of the \\nrecommended interventions. Different to the FANC \\nmodel, an additional contact is now recommended \\nat 20 weeks of gestation, and an additional three \\ncontacts are recommended in the third trimester \\n(defined as the period from 28 weeks of gestation \\nup to delivery), since this represents the period of \\ngreatest antenatal risk for mother and baby (see \\nBox\\xa05). At these third-trimester contacts, ANC \\nproviders should aim to reduce preventable morbidity \\nand mortality through systematic monitoring of \\nmaternal and fetal well-being, particularly in relation \\nto hypertensive disorders and other complications \\nthat may be asymptomatic but detectable during this \\ncritical period.\\nIf the quality of ANC is poor and women’s experience \\nof it is negative, the evidence shows that women \\nwill not attend ANC, irrespective of the number of \\nrecommended contacts in the ANC model. Thus, \\nthe overarching aim of the 2016 WHO ANC model \\nis to provide pregnant women with respectful, \\nChapter 4.

Effective implementation \\nof ANC requires a health systems approach and \\nstrengthening focusing on continuity of care, \\nintegrated service delivery, availability of supplies and \\ncommodities and empowered health-care providers.\\nThere are many different ways for health system \\nplanners to optimize ANC delivery by employing \\na range of strategies that can improve the \\nutilization and quality of ANC. The health system \\nrecommendations in this guideline have focused \\nmainly on those strategies that address continuity \\nof care, and improve communication with, and \\nsupport for, women (Recommendations E.1–E.4). The \\nrecommendations on task shifting and recruitment of \\nstaff (Recommendations E.5.1, E.5.2 and E.6) are also \\nimportant, as provider experience and attitudes have \\nan impact on the capacity of health systems to deliver \\nquality ANC; barriers to provider recruitment and job \\nsatisfaction will need to be addressed to successfully \\nimplement this guideline. Such barriers have been \\nshown to be significant in LMICs, and can prevent the \\nprovision of quality midwifery care (212). In addition \\nto improving the quality of care, these health system \\nrecommendations are intended to encourage health \\nsystem planners to operationalize the recommended \\neight ANC contacts in ways that are feasible in the \\nlocal context.\\nT able 2 shows the WHO ANC guideline \\nrecommendations mapped to the eight \\nrecommended contacts, thus presenting a summary \\nframework for the 2016 WHO ANC model in \\nsupport of a positive pregnancy experience.

Practices that are \\nnot recommended have been included in the table \\nfor informational purposes and highlighted in grey. \\nContext-specific recommendations for which rigorous \\nresearch is required before they can be considered \\nfor implementation have not been mapped to the \\nschedule of contacts.\\nAny intervention that is missed at an ANC contact, \\nfor any reason, should in principle be included at the \\nnext contact. Effective communication should be \\nfacilitated at all ANC contacts, to cover: presence of \\nany symptoms; promotion of healthy pregnancies and \\nnewborns through lifestyle choices; individualized \\nadvice and support; timely information on tests, \\nsupplements and treatments; birth-preparedness and \\ncomplication-readiness planning; postnatal family \\nplanning options; and the timing and purpose of ANC \\ncontacts. T opics for individualized advice and support \\ncan include healthy eating, physical activity, nutrition, \\ntobacco, substance use, caffeine intake, physiological \\nsymptoms, malaria and HIV prevention, and blood \\ntest results and retests. Communication should occur \\nin a respectful, individualized and person-centred \\nway. An effective referral system and emergency \\ntransport are also essential components of this ANC \\nmodel.\\nWithin the 2016 WHO ANC model, there are two \\nopportunities to arrange a single early ultrasound \\nscan (i.e. before 24 weeks of gestation): either at \\nthe first contact (up to 12 weeks of gestation) or at \\nthe second contact (20 weeks). The GDG suggests \\nthis pragmatic approach in order to increase the \\nproportion of pregnancies with accurate gestational \\nage assessments, especially in settings where \\nANC utilization is historically low; lack of accurate \\ngestational age assessment can compromise the \\ndiagnosis and/ or management of complications (such \\nas preterm birth and pre-eclampsia). It is important \\nto highlight that the frequency and exact timing of \\nsome of these ANC practices and interventions – \\nespecially related to malaria, tuberculosis and HIV \\n– may need to be adapted, based on the local context, \\npopulation and health system. Please refer to Box 6 \\nat the end of this chapter for considerations related \\nto the adoption, scale-up and implementation of the \\n2016 WHO ANC model.\\nThe GDG agreed that implementation of the 2016 \\nWHO ANC model should not wait for a large \\nmulticentre trial to be conducted to determine the \\noptimal number of contacts, or the impact of the \\nadditional recommended interventions, such as \\nultrasound, on pregnancy outcomes, resources, \\nequity and the other domains; rather, following \\nimplementation of the model, it should be subject \\nto ongoing monitoring and evaluation.

The potential barriers to implementation \\ninclude the following:\\nnn lack of human resources with the necessary \\nexpertise and skills to implement, supervise and \\nsupport recommended practices, including client \\ncounselling;\\nnn lack of infrastructure to support interventions, e.g. \\nlack of power to support ultrasound equipment;\\nnn lack of physical space to conduct individual or \\ngroup-based counselling;\\nnn lack of community understanding of the new \\nmodel of care, particularly around the contact \\nschedule and potentially longer wait times;\\nnn lack of physical resources, e.g. equipment, test kits, \\nsupplies, medicines and nutritional supplements; \\n8 This can be accessed at: search.optimizemnh.org\\nnn lack of effective referral mechanisms and care \\npathways for women identified as needing \\nadditional care;\\nnn lack of understanding of the value of newly \\nrecommended interventions among health-care \\nproviders and system managers.\\nnn lack of health information management systems \\n(HMISs) designed to document and monitor \\nrecommended practices (e.g. client cards, \\nregisters, etc.).\\nGiven the potential barriers noted above, a \\nphased approach to adoption, adaptation and \\nimplementation of the guideline recommendations \\nmay be prudent. Various strategies for addressing \\nthese barriers and facilitating implementation have \\nbeen suggested in the list of considerations at the end \\nof Chapter 4.\\nMonitoring and evaluating the impact of \\nthe guideline\\nThe implementation and impact of these \\nrecommendations will be monitored at the health-\\nservice, regional and country levels, based on clearly \\ndefined criteria and indicators that are associated \\nwith locally agreed targets. In collaboration with \\nthe monitoring and evaluation teams of the \\nWHO Departments of RHR and MCA, data on \\ncountry- and regional-level implementation of the \\nrecommendations will be collected and evaluated in \\nthe short to medium term to evaluate their impact on \\nnational policies of individual WHO Member States. \\nInterrupted time series, clinical audits or criterion-\\nbased audits could be used to obtain the relevant \\ndata on the interventions contained in this guideline.\\n6.3 Updating the guideline\\nIn accordance with the concept of WHO’s GREAT \\nNetwork, which employs a systematic and continuous \\nprocess of identifying and bridging evidence gaps \\nfollowing guideline implementation (214), the \\nproposed guideline will be updated five years \\nafter publication unless significant new evidence \\nemerges that necessitates earlier revision. The WHO \\nSteering Group will continue to follow the research \\ndevelopments in the area of ANC, particularly for \\nthose questions for which no evidence was found and \\nthose that are supported by low-quality evidence, \\nwhere new recommendations or a change in the \\npublished recommendation may be warranted,'),\n",

From my\\nprofessional life in obstetrics, and seeing women and\\npregnant people from all backgrounds, I have found there are\\nas many diﬀerent pregnancies and birth experiences as there\\nare individual people.\\nFinding out you are pregnant for the \\x00rst time, or indeed the second,\\nthird, or fourth times, can bring on a myriad of emotions – joy,\\nexcitement, reticence, fear, awe, curiosity, and, of course, anxiety.\\nThese feelings are completely natural, as is the need for advice. In the\\npast, societies with large families and different social structures\\ncreated a network of support to help and inform people about all\\nmatters pregnancy-related. By contrast, today we may talk about our\\npregnancy to only a handful of the closest family members and maybe\\nsome trusted friends, as well as to our midwife/birth attendant or\\nobstetrician every couple of weeks or so.\\nOften, our \\x00rst step is to perform an Internet search. Here there is\\nan abundance of information (and misinformation), and anecdotes of\\nthe pregnancy and childbirth experiences of other parents – including\\nthose that are unusually good or unusually disappointing. Sometimes\\nsearch results are informative but too often they can be confusing and\\nlead to further anxiety about our own experience.\\nYour questions answered\\nOn the following pages, we have aimed to provide the balanced advice\\nand support you need at one of the most important times of your life.\\nWe have covered every stage: pre-conception, the pregnancy, labour,\\nbirth, and even the \\x00rst three months of your baby’s life. We have\\narranged the chapters by theme, and question, helping you to \\x00nd the\\nanswers you are seeking, as well as other related subjects you might\\nwant to know about. A timetable of antenatal care is outlined and\\nexpert advice is given on what is likely to occur during your pregnancy,'),\n",

Almost 50 per cent of babies are born before the EDD and about the same again\\nare born after the EDD. You will reach full term at 37 weeks and if you haven’t given\\nbirth by 41 weeks you will be offered an induction to reduce the risk of having an\\noverdue baby.\\nWHEN WILL YOUR BABY BE BORN?\\nTo work out your estimated date of delivery (EDD) – also known as the due\\ndate – \\x00nd the date you started your last menstrual period (LMP) on the\\nupper lines of the chart, then see the dates in bold below to discover when\\nyour baby is expected.

The \\x00rst\\ntrimester lasts from the \\x00rst day of your last period to 12 weeks pregnant (you conceive at\\ntwo weeks). During this trimester you may experience lots of symptoms (see Early\\npregnancy symptoms). It can also be an anxious time because the risk of pregnancy loss is\\nhighest in the \\x00rst trimester. In the second trimester – from 13 weeks to 25 weeks pregnant\\n– you may have fewer symptoms, but will probably feel more pregnant because your belly\\nwill be more pronounced. The \\x00nal trimester, up to 42 weeks, can be tiring, due to the\\nweight of the baby, broken sleep, and symptoms such as backache. While this can be tough,\\nit is exciting too as you begin all the preparation for your baby’s arrival.\\nDid you know...\\nTwin pregnancies can bring additional nausea and sickness. While\\nit doesn’t happen for every expectant person of twins, there is an\\nincreased risk of nausea and sickness due to the higher hCG levels\\nin a twin, or other multiple, pregnancy. There are also higher\\nlevels of the hormone progesterone with twins, which can cause\\nshortness of breath. In later pregnancy, carrying multiple babies\\ncan lead to more fatigue, constipation, heartburn, and back pain\\nfor parent-to-be.\\nI’m pregnant but I have no symptoms. Should I be\\nworried?\\nIt’s normal for some women to experience few or no symptoms in early pregnancy, even\\nthough hormones are \\x00ooding the body and changes are underway. This is nothing to worry\\nabout – you are just as pregnant as a woman who has nausea and sickness, for example, but'),\n",
